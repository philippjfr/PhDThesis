\chapter{Exploring the role of inhibition in cortical development}

|  * Launch jobs SCAL and SEPI jobs parameterized with contrast and lateral 
|  excitatory strength, probably a 10x10 grid with 2 seeds each, i.e. 200 
|  jobs per model. Required measurements will include:
|       * Pinwheel/stability metrics
|       * RF measurement
|       * Size tuning measurements
|       * Gaussian fit to CFs to compare anatomical extent with model (new 
|  analysis)
|       * Computing orientation histogram of local excitatory and 
|  inhibitory connectivity
