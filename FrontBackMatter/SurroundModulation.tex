\chapter{Modeling the effect of visual input statistics on surround modulation in V1}

The previous chapter should have established that the lateral
connectivity in the model encodes various second order statistics
including the co-occurence of relative azimuths and orientation found
in a particular dataset. In this chapter we will discover how these
differences affect the encoding of information and surround
modulation.

The following analysis have been implemented and are ready to go:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Various flanker protocols replicating \cite{Kapadia1995}, \cite{Mizobe2001} and \cite{Polat1998}
  \item Decoding of activities based on feature maps.
\end{itemize}

These are the suggested next steps to complete this work:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Decode activities in response to various levels of curvature
    to compute what information lateral connections are conveying
    to the central neuron.
  \item Using these protocols demonstrate not only that the model
    exhibits contrast dependent flanker facilitation and suppression
    but that it is dependent on the training dataset.
\end{itemize}
