\chapter{Long-range interactions in the visual cortex}

In the previous chapters two novel models of the visual cortex have
been introduced to study how neurons in the visual cortex interact to
give rise to robust development but also meaningful responses. The
SEPI model in particular successfully models a wide range of effects
that occur in the cortex. Specifically we also tested whether the
model can robustly develop and respond even when strong long-range
excitatory patchy connections are introduced to the model. However
since these long-range projections are purely excitatory they cannot
mediate long-range suppressive effects directly and due to the weakly
tuned nature of the PV cell population they too aren't very good
candidates to mediate feature specific contextual modulation effects
such as iso-orientation suppression.

In the literature we have identified a second population of inhibitory
interneurons with interesting properties. The Somatostatin
immunoreactive (Sst) neurons are the second largest group of
interneurons and exhibit very different properties from the PV
population, which makes them interesting as a candidate to perform
long-range integration of inputs. Specifically they are enriched in
layer 2/3 where a lot of the long-range patchy connectivity is found
and they seem to respond strongly only under strong stimulation or for
very large stimuli. Additionally the input scaling does not seem to be
linear, with a accelerating response function driving much stronger
responses when they recruited consistently and robustly (as would be
the case for large or high contrast stimuli).

In this chapter we further extend the existing SEPI model by adding
this second population of inhibitory neurons modelled after the Sst
interneuron population. In doing so we will demonstrate how this
second population integrates large and high-contrast stimuli providing
strong suppression feature specific inhibition under those conditions,
while only very weakly responding in low contrast conditions.

Using this model we will demonstrate realistic long-range contextual
modulation effects such as flanker enhancement and suppression.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{The LESPI model}

\textbf{L}ong-\textbf{R}ange \textbf{E}xcitation, \textbf{S}sst and
\textbf{PV} \textbf{I}nhibition (LESPI) model again builds on the
previous models introducing an additional population of inhibitory
neurons, which is entirely recurrently driven via short- and
long-range projections by the two other populations. The diagram in
\ref{LESPIDiagram} shows how the three populations of V1 neurons are
recurrently connected.

The influence of the aggregate long-range excitatory and di-synaptic
inhibition via the Sst population is expressed as an additional
multiplicative factor modulating the response of the excitatory
neurons. The response of the excitatory population is then given by:

\begin{equation}
  \eta_{exc} = \frac{\eta_{A} + \eta_{LOC}}{1 + \eta_{PV}} * \eta_{SM}
\end{equation}

where $\eta_{A}$ is the LGN afferent activity, $\eta_{LOC}$ the local
excitatory contribution, $\eta_{P}$ the PV inhibitory contribution
and the surround modulation term $\eta_{SM}$ is defined as:

\begin{equation}
  \eta_{SM} = 1 + \eta_{LAT} - \eta_{S}
\end{equation}

where $\eta_{LAT}$ represents the long-range lateral excitatory
contribution and $\eta_{S}$ is the Sst inhibitory contribution. In the
SEPI model the $\eta_{SM}$ term simply reduces to 1, eliminating all
long-range interactions. The surround modulatorion term provides gain
when excitation exceeds inhibition and shunting inhibition when the
reverse is true. As such, this term provides a convenient abstraction
to model the modulatory influence of the dendritic integration of
long-range inputs.

The effective excitatory gain may not be a bad approximation to the
effect of long-range horizontal connections, which have been shown to
be strongly voltage dependent \citep{Hirsch1991}. Since Sst neurons
generally target distal dendrites they have generally been associated
with subtractive inhibition, they do however also have a
multiplicative component \citep{Wilson2012}. Additionally, their
preference for targetting distal dendrites may allow them to
effectively gate horizontal excitatory and feedback inputs
\citep{Ma2011, Gentet2012}. Additionally theoretical studies indicate
active dendritic spike backpropagation can lead to multiplicative
increases in gain, while reduction in spike backpropagation can lead
to divisive scaling of the firing rate \citep{Mehaffey2005}.

          kernel radii, while lightly shaded regions indicate kernel
          cut-off extents.}

The overall operation of this circuit can be summarized by the
schematic in \ref{circuit_diagram}. The diagram shows the preferential
linking of columns with similar orientation preference via patchy
long-range connections and the long-range integration of Sst neurons,
which receive both local and lateral input from pyramidal neurons,
providing di-synaptic inhibition to the local region. Furthermore it
suggests that under low-contrast conditions the Sst population is
effectively disabled, activating only under high contrast input.

      recurrent inhibition to neurons to columns in the local region,
      regardless of their orientation tuning. Long-range excitatory
      connections link pyramidal cells with similar orientation
      preference, while the Sst population integrates both local and
      long-range input to provide tuned orientation suppression under
      high contrast input.}

\subsection{Surround modulation}

Beyond measuring simple attributes of the spatial organization in LGN
and V1, higher order effecs can be explored through complex surround
modulation measurement protocols. In addition to the simple area
summation curve measurements described above we replicate two further
protocols to evaluate the spatial response properties of the model.
In particular we are interested in the interaction between the spatial
arrangement of visual patterns presented to an animal and the contrast
on the response properties of visually responding neurons. For that
purpose we replicate two measurement protocols, a simple annulus based
contrast suppression measurement \cite{Jones2002} and a protocol using
target and flanker stimuli performed by \cite{Kapadia1995}.

\paragraph{Orientation contrast suppression}

The orientation contrast suppression is perhaps one of the most well
studied surround modulation paradigms. The measurement involves
presenting stimuli of a central sine grating, optimized to the
preferred size, frequency and orientation of the neuron being
measured. Once the baseline activity has been measured an additional
surround anulus with the same frequency is added and varied in
contrast, size and orientation to measure orientation dependent
interactions between center and surround (as shown in Figure
\ref{ORC_Stimulus}).

\begin{figure}
	\centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{ORC_Stimulus.pdf}
	\caption{Orientation contrast stimulus measuring modulation by a
      sine grating annulus on the response of a central neuron
      responding to a central sine grating disk of the same frequency.
      Stimulus is varied by center and surround contrast, surround
      orientation and the offset between the central disk and the
      surround annulus.}
	\label{ORC_Stimulus}
\end{figure}

The surround facilitation is quantified as:

\begin{equation}
F = (\frac{R_{cs}}{R_c} - 1) * 100
\end{equation}

where $R_{CS}$ is the response of the combined stimulus and $R_C$ the
response to just the center stimulus.

\paragraph{Flanker Modulation}

Instead of working solely using area based protocols we also make use
of a simple bar based stimulus along with a flanker, which is
modulated in a number of ways to characterize the surround modulation
effects associated with this protocol. \cite{Kapadia1995} describe
a high degree of variability ranging from a complete lack of surround
modulation to facilitation and suppression. The three stimulus
protocols employed here are shown in \ref{Flanker}, we replicate these
protocol on the model to compare the effects observed in experiments
qualitatively.
