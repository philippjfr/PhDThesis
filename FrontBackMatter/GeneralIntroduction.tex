\chapter{Introduction}

One of the major experimental advances in visual neuroscience over the
past decade has been the ability to manipulate and record from
individual cells or cell classes by combining advanced genetic and
imaging techniques. These techniques have given us a new window into
the mammalian brain and have allowed us to begin hypothesizing what
role different cell classes may play in development and
behavior. However, so far very few attempts have been made to place
these new findings into a greater context, particularly to investigate
what makes different cell classes suited toward particular functions
and how these neurons develop into a functional circuit thath can
efficiently extract and encode the statistics of the visual input.

The guiding hypothesis of this thesis is that the incredible
complexity of the mammalian cortex is constructed through a process of
self-organization giving rise to a developed circuit, which can
robustly capture the statistics of the input and adaptively use this
information to optimally encode the input for further processing and
perform low-level inferences even when only a small amount of
information is available. Over the course of this thesis I will
outline how a stereotyped circuit of different neural cell classes
develops into a specialized circuit that closely matches experimental
observations of development and surround modulation. This model will
for the first time bridge the early development of the circuits with a
mechanistic account of how the learned statistics are used and finally
play a role in specific cortical functions, which give rise to
contextual modulation effects and higher level behaviors.

In particular I will adapt an existing developmental model of cortical
development, which gives a good account of activity-dependent
development in the primary visual cortex, demonstrating robust, yet
adaptive organization of receptive fields and lateral connectivity.
Once I have established how to relate the spatial scales in the model
to experimental data, this thesis sets out to answer a number of
questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item What type of inhibition is suited toward driving robust
  self-organization of V1 circuits?
\item What are the roles of parvalbumin- and somatostatin-immunoreactive
  interneurons in the development and function of the primary visual
  cortex?
\item What properties make a particular cell class suited for a
  particular function?
\item How do the cell classes self-organize into a circuit that is
  robust and stable to the widely varying visual input that an
  animal's environment provides?
\item What specific computational purpose, if any, do particular cell
  classes serve?
\item What are the tradeoffs between long-range recurrent excitation
  and inhibition for stimulus detection and discriminability?
\item Does the connectivity in the visual cortex store the visual
  statistics of the environment, and how can it begin using this
  information to improve neural coding and low-level inference?
\end{itemize}

Through an iterative process of analyzing the model and incorporating
increasing anatomical and physiological detail, I make several
concrete predictions about the role in both developmental and
behavioral processes. Firstly I introduce the first developmental
model which agrees with anatomical connectivity data,
electrophysiological measurements and the known spatial scales of
orientation maps in V1.  Having established this I show that the fast,
quickly spiking response properties of parvalbumin-expressing neurons
can provide the fast local and largely isotropic inhibition of
surrounding neurons that is crucial for robust orientation map
development.

Through a further extension of the model I show that the facilitating
and slow response profile of somatostatin-immunoreactive neurons give
rise to narrower orientation tuning, which provides
orientation-dependent surround suppression. In doing so the thesis
will explore the tension between strong long-range recurrent
excitation, useful for detection under uncertain or weak stimulus
conditions, and suppression, useful to reduce the redundancy in the
neural representation and enhancing discrimination under strong
stimulus conditions. Finally, I show how the long-range lateral
connectivity is able to capture the statistics of the input, acting to
normalize higher-order statistics in the input, thereby optimizing the
neural code, and relate these results to the known patchy connectivity
in the primate visual cortex.

Not only does this thesis outline the first spatially calibrated,
developmental model of the primary visual cortex, it also makes specific
predictions about the role of different cell classes, which have been
implicated in a variety of pathologies, most notably in autism,
schizophrenia and Parkinson's. A better understanding of the
developmental disruptions caused by malfunctioning parvalbumin neurons
in particular will provide a better understanding of how to recover
regular function and provides a solid starting point for future
studies looking specifically at these disruptions. Furthermore, these
results have clear implications for theoretical neuroscience and
machine learning fields as they clearly predict that not only is the
lateral connectivity in V1 shaped by the visual statistics of the
environment but also suggests that even low-level areas like V1 can
make use of these statistics to optimize neural coding.

\section{Organization of the Thesis}

After a thorough review of the existing literature, I present a
workflow for easily and reproducibly exploring high-dimensional and
temporally evolving models, allowing us to gain insights into
non-linear interactions between different components and parameters in
a model in ways that were not possible with previous tools.

The following chapter then introduces the initial developmental model
of the visual cortex, summarizing what is known about the spatial scales
of different types of connections in primary visual cortex and
establishing a correspondence between the model and experimental data. In
the process, we present various protocols to characterize the spatial
tuning in the response of the model and various analyses applied to
the connectivity in the model to confirm that model and experiment are
indeed in close agreement.

In the second results chapter I extend this analysis to models of
cortical development and function that takes into account the
anatomical and physiological properties of different cell classes and
begin elucidating their role in experimentally observed phenomena
ranging from self-organization to particular computations performed by
the fully developed cortex, including surround modulation, divisive
gain control and sparse coding.

In the following chapter we introduce a second population of
inhibitory interneurons demonstrating how the interactions between
these neurons and long-range excitatory connections through a
di-synaptic circuit can account for both feature specific facilitation
and suppression.

In the final results chapter I further show that the long-range
connections successfully capture higher-order correlations in natural
images, explaining mechanistically how and why feature specific
modulation arises in the cortex.

The thesis overall presents a unifying account of how different cell
classes in the visual cortex self-organize into a robust circuit that
can encode the natural image statistics of its rearing environment and
make use of that information to improve how the cortex extracts,
encodes and uses information from its environment.
