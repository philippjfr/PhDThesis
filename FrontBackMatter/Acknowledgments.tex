\chapter*{Acknowledgements} % Acknowledgements section text

First of all I would like to thank my supervisor Jim Bednar for his
thoughtful advice and support throughout the course of this project
and for hugely influencing my thinking about the field of
neuroscience. My thanks also extend to my second supervisor Alexander
Thiele who provided patient advice although the topic of the PhD
quickly shifted away from his main interests. I am also deeply
grateful to the other members of the Institute of Adaptive and Neural
Computation for their invaluable support and help over the past few
years. In particular I would like to thank Jean-Luc Stevens for
discussions and feedback that have helped me refine the ideas that
make up the core of this thesis.

I would also to thank my family who have been supportive throughout my
studies and allowed me to pursue them in the first place. My father
who has nurtured my intellectual curiosity since I was a child and my
godmother who has been more supportive than anyone could hope
for. Finally a very special thanks to my partner and friend Josephine
for being patient while I worked day and night on this project.
