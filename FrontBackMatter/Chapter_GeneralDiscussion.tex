\chapter{General Discussion}

\subsection{Simple and complex cells}

Outline the issues with modeling only simple cells and offer
suggestions on extending the model to complex cells

\subsection{Inhibitory subtypes}

Summarize what we have learned about the role of PV in visual cortex
and how it fits into current research on plasticity

Discuss role of Sst in gating feedback connectivity and suggest
roles for ViP population.

\subsection{Neuromodulation of visuo-cortical information processing}

Detail plans on modeling modulatory influences on the developed
circuitry.
