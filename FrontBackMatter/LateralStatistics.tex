\chapter{Modelling the effects of visual statistics on long-range lateral connectivity in visual cortex}

One of the major problems in computational neuroscience is in
understanding how the brain can robustly capture information about its
environment to improve how new information is encoded and
processed. One of the major benefits of the developmental models such
as those developed in the previous chapters is that the developed
synaptic connections reflect the visual statistics of the
input. Therefore we can make predictions about how the statistics
embedded in the visual inputs is reflected in the organization of the
model and could be used to aid cortical computations.

A number of studies have investigated the role visual statistics play
in shaping the organization of cortex. In particular it has been shown
that the distribution of orientations in the orientation maps can be
strongly affected by altering the visual experience of an animal
through manipulations like goggle rearing \cite{Tanaka2006}. However
the evidence for the encoding of second-order statistics in lateral
connections has been much harder to study and even coarse approaches
such as measuring the isotropy of lateral connections along the axis
of preferred orientation has not yielded uniform results. While a
number of studies have found that lateral connections are elongated
along the axis of preferred orientation in tree shrew
\citep{Bosking1997}, cat \citep{Schmidt1997} and owl monkey
\citep{Sincich2001} in macaque this anisotropy could be explained by
the anisotropy in cortical magnification such that the connections are
not elongated in visual space \citep{Angelucci2002}.  Whether this
reflects differences in rearing environments or actual species
differences is not fully clear, as the tracer injections required to
reconstruct the lateral connections can be performed at most on a few
cells in a single animal, making the collection of a lot of data
infeasible.

Although there is a clear lack of data in this area a few attempts
have been made to go further and establish whether the lateral
projections connect co-circular orientation domains, relecting the
co-circularity in natural images \citep{Hunt2011}. These studies have
again been inconclusive due to the sparsity of good quality data.

In this chapter we will employ the model introduced in the previous
chapter to analyze to what extent the statistics of the visual input
shape the long-range excitatory connections and attempt to reconstruct
those statistics based purely on synaptic weights and orientation
map. In doing so we will determine to what extent they can capture the
statistics of the training dataset and establish whether considerable
biases in the inputs could affect the isotropy of connections.

\section{Methods}

\subsubsection{Synthetic stimuli} \label{synthetic}

The stimuli generated for this purpose are simple extensions of the
elongated 2D Gaussian stimuli used to train the models up to this
point. The model will draw 1 stimulus per unit area, which consists of
a chain of three Gaussian pattern, the patterns can be seen in
Figure~\ref{GaussianStatistics}. The middle Gaussian determines the
overall orientation ($\theta_M$) of the pattern, and the outer
Gaussians are offset in orientation by a value drawn from a vonMises
distribution with a mean of $\theta_M$ and a $\kappa$ of ${0.5,
  8}$. The patterns are then spatially offset so that they form a
chain forming an 'S' shape. By varying the $\kappa$ we can vary how
the distribution of co-occurence statistics increasing the preference
for simple elongated bars.

      distribution with different $\kappa$ values changing the
      distribution of orientation offsets.}
    \label{GaussianStatistics}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Co-occurence statistics}

The co-occurrence of natural image statistics have been well
characterized in a number of papers. Specifically, in a recent paper
\cite{Perrinet2015} analyzed the edge co-occurence statistics in
natural images by labeling images with edges at varying frequencies,
scales, orientations and phases through a greedy algorithm and then
computing both the relative orientation between each pair of edges and
the normalized azimuthal angle between them. An example image with
labeled edges is shown in Figure~\ref{classifier}, along with a
diagram showing how the co-occurence were computed. Similar analysis
approaches have been used to visualize the co-occurrence statistics in
natural images, such as those produced by \cite{Geisler2001} to
predict the performance of human subjects in contour detection tasks.

      objects. A) The different layers used to train the
      classifier. The natural images are first fed through a model
      retina, all the edges are labeled with positions and
      scales. Using a greedy algorithm a set of edges accounting for
      the largest amount of luminance variance within the original
      image are selected. Using this set of edges the edge
      co-occurence statistics were computed and finally the classifier
      was trained based on these statistics. B) The sparse set
      of labelled edges extracted from a single image. C) Diagram

      $\phi$ and relative azimuth $\psi$ are computed from two
      edges. Reproduced from \cite{Perrinet2015}.}
	\label{classifier}
\end{figure}

The afferent receptive fields in the visual cortex are usually assumed
to act as feature detectors reducing the dimensionality of the visual
``pixel`` space into a lower dimensional representation. Connections
between these feature detectors could therefore at least in theory
represent the co-occurence statistics of the low level features. In
primary visual cortex they could therefore represents the co-occurence
of simple oriented edges. In order to test this assumption the models
were trained one various synthetic and natural image datasets and the
statistics embedded in the lateral connections were decoded.

This was done by computing the angles $\theta$, $\phi$ and $\psi$ (as
defined in figure (C) in Figure~\ref{classifier}) as well as the
euclidean distance of the receptive fields centers for each pre- and
post-synaptic pair of neurons and then binning them weighted by the
strength of connections between them. The angle $\theta$ was computed
simply as the difference between the pre- and post-synaptic neurons'
orientation preference in the orientation map and their position was
defined by computing the center of gravity of their afferent receptive
fields, allowing the angles $\phi$ and $\psi$ to be calculated. As in
previous analyses the weights were first thresholded leaving only the
strongest 10\%, ensuring that the model roughly matches the known
sparse and patchy pattern observed in anatomical tracing
studies. Additionally the neurons were selected from strong
iso-orientation regions by selecting the neurons with a local
homogeneity index above the 50th percentile. The resulting histograms
could then be further analyzed.

\subsubsection{Univariate statistics}

The simplest way to analyze these statistics was to collapse across
the dimensions to visualize the univariate distributions of the
$\theta$, $\phi$ and distance of connections. This provides an easily
understood analysis to demonstrate how strongly the connections are
biased for similar orientation, co-linear directions, an indication of
how isotropic the lateral connections are in the model and finally the
distances.

\subsubsection{Multi-variate statistics}

Using the computed histogram various plots could be generated to
compare against the plots produced by directly extracting the edge
co-occurrences from images in the \cite{Perrinet2015} and
\cite{Geisler2001} studies.

The first of these plots (Figure~\ref{SyntheticCooccurrence}), called
a Chevron map, presents the bivariate distribution of $\theta$ and
$\psi$, highlighting which spatial arrangement of edges is most likely
to co-occur. In these plots the central $1^\circ$ diameter region of
the lateral field was ignored so the plot would reflect co-occurrence
statistics of connections outside the receptive field of the
neuron. This also allowed comparing the co-occurrences between
datasets by taking the ratio of normalized weights in each bins.

The \cite{Geisler2001} type co-occurence plots on the other hand
reflect three dimensions, the angles $\theta$ and $\phi$ and the
distance, displaying the probability of an edge of a particular
orientation, co-occurring at a particular distance and azimuth
relative to the edge. It is then possible to plot the data to ask to
two related questions, (1) what is the most likely orientation of an
edge given the distance and azimuth, and (2) where is the most likely
position of an edge of a specific orientation at a specific
distance. These will be referred to as the co-circularity and
co-linearity maps respectively. \citep{Geisler2001} directly analyzed
natural image patterns for this analysis, providing a direct measure
of the statistics. In the model there is only the weights which we can
decode the statistics from. In addition to taking the weight to
compute each co-occurrence the selectivity for each orientation and
azimuth were also determined by computing the vector sum.

\subsubsection{vonMises Model}

Finally the lateral weights were again fit using the vonMises model
with both Gaussian and orientation preference dependent components,
which was first introduced in Section~\ref{BuzasEquations}. This
allows us to provide a quantitative assesment of how well the lateral
connections can be approximated with a simple model that is made up of
orientation, direction and spatially dependent components. Most
importantly the direction dependent component allows us to quantify
how strongly the lateral connection fields are biased along the axis
of preferred orientation.

\subsection{Training stimuli}

The first step was to train the model on the different image datasets,
which had already been analyzed for their co-occurence statistics
(Figure~\ref{classifier}). The datasets fed to the model comprised the
two datasets used as part of the paper and one additional image
dataset recorded in treeshrew cages in the David Fitzpatrick lab at
Duke University, which features great numbers of extended,
high-contrast bars (shown in figure \ref{image_patterns}).

\section{Results}

In order to understand the effect of different stimulus patterns on
the organization of the lateral connections both synthetic and natural
image were used. To begin with the synthetic stimulus trained model
will be analyzed to ensure the approaches work well in the simple case
and will then be extended to the natural image trained models, where a
number of issues could disrupt the model organization.

\subsection{Synthetic Stimuli}

In order to keep the analysis tractable, at least initially, a
synthetic and parameterizeable set of stimuli were used. The stimuli
described in Section \ref{synthetic} vary in both relative orientation
and azimuth, which means that if the lateral connections capture the
correlations in the inputs these correlations should also be captured
and vary depending on the width of the vonMises distributions the
orientation offsets are drawn from.

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{./results/lespi/Synthetic_Distributions.pdf}

      ($\kappa=8$) condition. C) Orientation distribution of lateral

      narrowly distributed condition.}
	\label{SyntheticDistributions}
\end{figure}

By analyzing and binning the lateral weights by orientation
difference, relative azimuth and distance we can get begin to
understand what the lateral connections are actually capturing. The
difference in lateral fields between a model trained on the synthetic
stimuli with a very wide distribution ($\kappa=0.5$) and a much
tighter distribution ($\kappa=8$) is shown in
Figure~\ref{SyntheticDistributions}. This simple analysis already
makes it clear that both conditions show a strong preference for
similar orientations and co-linear stimuli, as can be seen when
looking at the azimuth histogram, which highlights a strong isotropy
along the axis of preferred orientation. This can indeed be seen even
when just looking at the sample lateral connection fields
directly. The analysis also highlights that the model trained on
patterns drawn from the tighter distribution has a slightly stronger
preference for similar orientations, and more weights at larger
distances. This reflects the stronger bias for long iso-oriented, and
co-linear contours in the input patterns.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
        \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{./results/lespi/Synthetic_Cooccurrences.pdf}
	\caption[Chevron map showing the distribution of orientation and
      azimuth differences between pre- and post-synaptic
      neurons.]{Chevron map showing the distribution of orientation

      them. Modelled after \cite{Perrinet2015} co-occurrence analysis
      of natural images. Each `chevron` represents on particular
      configuration of two edges, varying by $\psi$ (relative azimuth)
      along the x-axis and $\theta$ (orientation difference) along the
      y-axis. Increased probability is shown in red, and lower
      probabilities shown in blue. Highlights the stronger bias for
      connecting iso-orientation regions in the model trained on
      narrowly distributed synthetic patterns.}
	\label{SyntheticCooccurrence}
\end{figure}

The Chevron map of edge co-occurrences, shown in
Figure~\ref{SyntheticCooccurrence}, highlights very similar trends. In
particular it demonstrates a greater spread in co-occurring
orientations as the distribution of orientation offsets in the input
pattern widens. Both the azimuth distribution and the co-occurrence
histogram also emphasize and increased preference of parallel
alignment for the tighter distribution. It is not quite clear what
drives these correlations as they are not present in the input
pattern, however through parameter exploration not shown here it was
determined that they could be reduced by presenting fewer overlapping
patterns, indicating they are artifacts.

    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{./results/lespi/Geisler_Synthetic_Cooccurrence.pdf}

      connections to highlight the most likely orientation at each

      row). The colormap represents the relative probability of each
      configuration while the size reflects the selectivity for that
      particular arrangement.}
	\label{SyntheticGeisler}
\end{figure}

A further analysis using plots originally developed by
\cite{Geisler2001} demonstrates just how well the network has captured
the co-occurrence statistics of the input. The co-linearity plot
almost perfectly reflects the statistics of the input, in that the
same orientation is encountered along the axis of preferred
orientation and as we move away from this axis the preferred angle
slowly shifts away from this orientation, which is precisely how the
input pattern is defined. Additionally the model trained on the
dataset with a narrower distribution also exhibits a narrower
distribution in the co-circularity plots. This means the model has
captured not just the rough characteristics of the input but can also
capture subtler manipulations of the input. However the statistics of
the synthetic training patterns are very simplistic and capturing the
far broader distribution of visual statistics, including spatial
frequencies and spatial arrangements of patterns, that are present in
natural images is a more difficult task.

\subsection{Natural Images}

Natural and man-made environments have very different statistics,
which may be reflected in the lateral connections in the primary
visual cortex. So far we have seen that the LESPI model can indeed
capture the statistics of a simplified input pattern. Now we will a
train the model on a number of different image datasets either from
natural environments or artificial structures such as laboratory
environments. Using detailed labelling and analysis of these datasets,
which include those used by \citep{Perrinet2015} and \citep{Serre2007}
we will demonstrate that the lateral connections in V1 can already
capture the differences between different datasets, which may suggest
that they can already aid in rapid image classification based on very
low level co-occurrence statistics. Additionally we suggest that that
the rearing environment of an animal can have strong effects on the
organization of the visual system, which should be considered when
using animal models.

Man-made environments environments are characterized by co-linear,
parallel and orthogonal arrangements of edges, while true natural
images, i.e. images of natural environments, exhibit more curvature
and textured patterns \citep{Perrinet2015}. In order to test whether
the model would capture these differences a dataset three datasets
were used (1) the ``natural`` dataset containing a lot of grass
textures, (2) the ``treeshrew`` laboratory cage containing long high
contrast bars and (3) the \citep{Serre2007} target dataset of natural
scenes and animals. These represent three highly distinct visual
environments, which should be reflected in long range connections.

\subsubsection{First order statistics}

Before investigating more complex second order statistics, we analyzed
to check if partical orientations were hugely overrepresened in the
orientation map, which could introduce systematic biases to the
results. As can be seen in Figure~\ref{NatImgORs}, both dataset show
some bias for specific orientations, with the treeshrew condition
exhibiting a stronger bias along the horizontal and vertical
axes. This is likely an artifact arising from the artificial border at
the edge of the simulated sheet, which can affect the whole map
through long-range interactions.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{./results/lespi/NatImg_ORDistribution.pdf}
	\caption[Distribution of orientations in the orientation map of
      models trained on natural and laboratory images.]{Distribution
      of orientations in the orientation map of models trained on (A)
      natural and (B) laboratory images. Although all images were
      rotated to eliminate biases in the original dataset long-range
      interactions and border effects cause some biases in the model.}
	\label{NatImgORs}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Second order histograms}

Once again we compare the isotropy, orientation and distance
histograms between the two conditions (as shown in
Figure~\ref{NatImgDistributions}, which highlight significant
differences between the datasets. Specifically the orientation
histogram is biased much more strongly towards iso-orientations in the
natural condition. The natural condition is also considerably more
orientation selective on average, which is what drives the development
of the lateral connections. However, even though the treeshrew neurons
are a lot less selective they actually exhibit a stronger bias along
the axis of preferred orientation, with highly anisotropic lateral
connection fields. Finally we can see there is a lot more weight at
distant locations, suggesting the natural patterns exhibit more
long-range correlations overall.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
        \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{./results/lespi/NatImg_Distributions.pdf}
	\caption[Distributions of lateral weights broken down by azimuth,
      orientation and distance.]{Distributions of lateral weights
      broken down by (A) azimuth, (B) orientation and (C) distance for
      the natural and treeshrew datasets.}
	\label{NatImgDistributions}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Chevron Maps}

The Chevron maps offer a different view of these effects,
(Figure~\ref{NatImgCooccurrences}) as we can now see the relative
co-occurrence along both the relative azimuth and orientation
dimensions at the providing an overview of the likelihood of various
geometric arrangements. The views analyzing each dataset individually
highlight once again just how much more biased the connections are
along the $\theta$ dimension, i.e. that the connections are more
biased for similar orientations rather than specific azimuths. However
it also demonstrates that in the natural condition co-linear lines are
not much more likely than any other azimuth, which reaffirms the more
circular azimuth histogram that can be seen in
Figure~\ref{NatImgDistributions}. Comparing the distributions to ask
whether certain configurations are more likely in one dataset than the
other highlights some more interesting differences.

Specifically we can clearly see a stronger bias for parallel lines in
the natural dataset and one for orthogonal lines in the treeshrew
dataset. This may reflect the difference between textured grass
patterns with a lot of parallel arrangements and man-made structures
which exhibit far more right-angles than would usually be seen in
nature. At the same time certain curvatures are seen more strongly in
the treeshrew condition, which is surprising but may merely reflect
the lower orientation selectivity that is evident when training on
that dataset. An analysis that considers the relative orientation
independently from the azimuth may therefore shed more light on the
actual differences.

      of co-occurrence, while blue indicates lower
      probability. Chevron maps for natural and treeshrew dataset
      shown on top and probability ratios comparing one dataset
      against the other below.}
	\label{NatImgCooccurrences}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Co-linearity and co-circularity}

Instead of considering both orientation and azimuth co-occurrences at
the same time we can treat each separately ensuring that one does not
drown out the other. The co-linearity and co-circularity plots, shown
in Figure~\ref{NatImgGeisler} alongside the results from
\cite{Geisler2001} and \cite{Perrinet2015} make these differences very
clear. Note that while the direct analysis can directly compute the
probability, the model indicates both relative probability and
confidence via the color and size respectively. Comparing just the
direct analysis to the model results for the Serre animal dataset and
the treeshrew cage dataset we can make several observations. The
treeshrew data has a much tighter distribution in the co-linearity
domain, is much more confident about the co-linearity at directions
that lie on the axis of preferred orientation, and also extends across
a much further distance. All three indicate a strong bias for
co-linear arrangements, which can also be observed in the plots
obtained directly from the datasets. However it also highlights that
decoding the azimuth from the weights adds considerable uncertainty as
the distribution is not nearly as tight as observed in experiments.

The co-circularity results also show a lot of commonalities with
almost uniformly high probability and confidence for co-circular
arrangements. However while it has assigned co-circular arrangements
very high probability in the natural condition (indicated by a bright
color) it also as assigned them low confidence indicating that
co-linear edges co-occur almost equally strongly at all azimuths. The
other striking feature about the natural condition model results is
the high confidence it has assigned to orthogonal orientations at the
axes orthogonal to the preferred orientation, even though they have
such a low overall probability. This may be driven by criss-crossing
textures such grass. Similar cross-orientation arrangements can be
observed in the Geisler results, even though it also does not assign
them very high probability. In all three model conditions the lateral
weights assign high probability to co-circular patterns however, which
is exactly what was predicted by \citep{Geisler2001}. Additionally
there is clear dataset dependent differences, which seem to match the
apparent statistics of the inputs. However there also seems to be
considerable error in decoding the relative azimuths and local
interactions, which reduce the confidence and probabilities at short
distances.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Quantifying the anisotropy}

The analyses so far have allowed us to make qualitative assessments of
how well the lateral connections in the model match the statistics in
the input patterns. In order to test whether the lateral connections
in the model are comparable to the long-range patchy connections in
layer 2/3 of V1 we will also confirm how well the lateral connections
fields are fit by the \cite{Buzas2006} model of lateral connectivity
that was introduced in \ref{BuzasEquations}. By adding the aspect
ratio of the long-range Gaussian as an additional free parameter we
can also quantitatively assess the isotropy along the axis of
preferred orientation to test our hypothesis that the anisotropy of
lateral connections observed in experiments \cite{Bosking1997} could
be explained by differences in rearing environments.

After fitting the model to all the neurons we selected the best fits
for the treeshrew and natural conditions and the error between the fit
and the actual weight pattern, allowing us to see features the model
did not capture very well. The comparison between the two fits is
shown in \ref{NatImgvonMises}. It is immediately obvious that the
treeshrew weights are considerably more elongated along the axis of
preferred orientation. The patterns of the error also highlight
several issues however, first of all it seems to assign too little
weight to the nearby iso-orientation patches, which are strongly
connected in the actual weights. Additionally there are patches that
have been assigned weight but do not have any in the actual weight
patterns. These are likely associated with phase-inversions, since the
model consists entirely of simple cells, which means that locally
iso-orientation patches with opposite phase are anti-correlated, a
feature the Buzas model does not capture.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
        \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{./results/lespi/NatImg_vonMises_Fit.pdf}

      for the two conditions. C, F) Error between fitted and actual
      lateral weight fields.}
	\label{NatImgvonMises}
\end{figure}

In order to confirm that the model indeed captures the orientation
dependent component well we also let it fit the orientation directly
and confirmed the fitted orientation was well correlated with the
orientation preference in the orientation map. Overall this analysis
showed very high correlation between the estimated and measured
orientation as can be seen in Figure~\ref{NatImgvonMisesAspect}
A. Additionally we plotted the aspect ratio of the long range Gaussian
pattern against the orientation selectivity of the neurons. In the
treeshrew model the selectivity was highly correlated with the aspect,
while in the natural condition this correlation was much
weaker. Overall the mean aspect ratio for the natural condition was
1.29, while the treeshrew trained model exhibited an aspect ratio of
2.2, suggesting a much higher anisotropy along the axis of preferred
orientation.

\section{Discussion}

In this chapter we explored the effect of changing the co-occurrence
statistics of the visual training on the long-range lateral
connections in a developmental model of V1 in order to test whether
various results concerning the co-circularity \citep{Hunt2011} and
anisotropy of lateral connections \citep{Bosking1997} could be
explained by differences rearing environments. Additionally we are
interested to what extent the early visual cortex is involved in
computations concerning the co-occurrence statistics to determine
whether they could be involved in computing higher order properties
such as the difference between animal and non-animal objects, which
has been shown to be computed very rapidly in human psychophysics
experiments \citep{Serre2007b}.

In performing the analysis we demonstrated that the model could
capture the statistics of simplified stimuli almost perfectly (see
Figure~\ref{SyntheticGeisler}) and demonstrated that it could even
extract the statistics of far more complex natural image stimuli to a
reasonable extent, including clear differences between various
datasets. This provides the first demonstration that a developmental
of V1 can indeed capture the statistics of natural images and can
learn various Gestalt rules for edge co-linearity and co-circularity
without hard-coding them. This suggests that encoding higher-order
statistics in the lateral connections is a general principle in the
cortex and predicts that early sensory cortices of all modalities
should capture these correlations in some way. It also highlights that
the common assumption that patchy connections in the primary visual
cortex merely link columns with similar orientation preference highly
simplistic and ignores the fact that this is simply reflects the
co-occurrence probabilities in the natural world.

Furthermore we quantify the effect of training the model in a
laboratory environment with very long, high-contrast cages and suggest
that this highly biased rearing environment will have large
implications for the organization of long-range lateral connections,
exhibiting a considerably stronger anisotropy along the axis of
preferred orientation with an anisotropy ratio of 2.2, which is
considerably higher than the anisotropy ratio of 1.29 in the model
trained on natural images. On this basis we predict that the large
anisotropy ratios observed by \citep{Bosking1997} may at least
partially explained by the rearing environment of these animals.

The novel analyses described in this chapter provide a framework to
answer questions about how higher-order correlations are captured in
the model. In future these analyses should be extended to link the
statistics encoded in the lateral connections back to the surround
modulation effects we previously showed are mediated by them. Before
such an analysis can be performed a number of issues should be
addressed.

\subsection{Spatial Frequency}

The spatial frequency distribution of natural images has been well
described in the literature as having a 1\\f
distribution. Additionally \cite{Perrinet2015} has shown that the
co-occurrence statistics are generally independent of the spatial
frequency. However the LESPI model currently only uses a single
spatial frequency filter at the level of the LGN meaning that certain
spatial frequencies are filtered out. Additionally the image patterns
used for training potentially diverge considerably from the 1\\f
distribution that has been found empirically. Indeed by investigating
the selectivity of the model trained on treeshrew images we could show
that they generally have lower spatial frequency preference than the
model trained on the natural dataset. This in turn affects the
selectivity of the model since broader spatial frequency tuning also
results in lower orientation selectivity. A future analysis should
either employ a wider range of spatial frequency filters at the LGN
level or ensure that the distribution of spatial frequency is
approximately equal across the tested datasets.

This may be particularly important because the orientation selectivity
between the models trained on the treeshrew and natural dataset
differs quite considerably, which makes comparing between them very
difficult. Specifically the Chevron maps are dominated by the
difference in orientation selectivity, which partially obscures the
the differences in azimuths.

\subsection{Complex cells and phase preference}

Another major question regarding the current analysis concerns the
fact that all the modeled neurons are simple cells by nature. As it is
known that long-range patchy connections emerge in layer 2/3, where
there is a mix of simple and complex cells this makes drawing concrete
conclusions very difficult. In particular, complex cells pool over
phase, which means they discard some of the positional information,
complicating the encoding of relative azimuth between two
edges. Extending the model to incorporate complex cells as outlined in
\cite{Antolik2010} may address some of these questions and would allow
us to make concrete predictions about the differences of lateral
connections linking simple and complex cells, which could be tested in
experiments.

Indeed the large difference in anisotropy that are observed in
treeshrews lateral connections compared to other species could reflect
the fact that layer 2/3 in treeshrews has a greater proportion of
simple cells since orientation selectivity is thought to emerge from
the connections between layer 4 and 2/3 rather than thalamocortical
projections as in other species \citep{VanHooser2013}.

\subsection{Local isotropy and suppression}

So far we have mainly discussed to what extent the connections do
reflect the statistics of the natural images the model was trained
on. There are however also clear and systematic differences which
likely reflect properties of the underlying circuit. Since the cortex
has to map high-dimensional visual features onto the 2D surface of the
cortex, there are some tradeoffs in representing all the features
perfectly. In particular since orientation is mapped onto discrete
columns the local relationships there is some distortion in the way
position is represented locally, which can be seen in some of the
co-circularity plots, which show maximal co-linear enhancement
slightly offset from the center. Additionally the local isotropic
suppression provided by the PV population will strongly suppress
cross-oriented stimuli locally, which means they do not generally show
up in the co-circularity plots as is particularly evident in the
natural condition, where they do appear at longer distances.

From a functional perspective these do not seem like major issues
since the neurons if the lateral connections are primarily concerned
with capturing co-occurrences rather than simply reflecting the
preference of the neuron in the classical receptive field. This once
again highlights the importance to consider the visuotopic extent of
lateral connections when compared to the size of the receptive
field. Depending on the species and eccentricity the neurons could
shift being primarily devoted to mediating effects within the
classical receptive field to playing a modulatory role to transmit
information from the extra-classical receptive field. Systematically
characterizing both the receptive field size and the extent of lateral
connections may therefore shed some light on their primary function.

As we concluded in the surround modulation chapter the lateral
connections in parafoveal regions of the macaque are just big enough
to mediate interactions at the borders of different textures or
between contour elements and beyond the cRF of a neuron.

\subsection{Implications for surround modulation and perception}

Having confirmed that lateral connections may be able to capture the
co-occurrence statistics of the input it is important to ask what
purpose this may serve. One of the guiding hypothesis of this thesis
and the developmental models the thesis is built on is that the
mammalian brain self-organizes based on the activity dependent
processes in order to best represent the statistics of the input. This
means that identical processes can give rise to the development of
orientation maps in visual cortex and tonotopic maps in the auditory
cortex. Rather than encoding the precise function of each brain region
the brain robustly, yet adaptively organizes in such a way that it can
optimally represent whatever input it is given. This idea is supported
by experiments performed by the Sur lab, where the retinal projection
to the LGN were rewired to the auditory thalamus and demonstrated the
animals would develop of visual receptive fields in auditory cortex
and even learn to perform various visual tasks
\citep{vonMelchner2000}.

Based on this evidence and the results presented here we argue that
the organization of the visual cortex is to a large extent an
experience dependent process and even surround modulation effects such
as contour integration and iso-orientation surround suppression are
emergent phenomena, arising because the cortex learns to represent the
visual statistics of the inputs. The role of lateral connections then
is to learn co-occurrences of the inputs expressing the model
predictions either as suppressive or facilitatory effects depending of
the geometric arrangement of the stimuli, the contrast and other
contextual information. By learning that edges in the visual
environment are generally co-linearly and co-circularly arranged even
the very earliest stages of visual processing can contribute towards
complex computations, such as detecting visually salient features
through the learned Gestalt grouping laws.

In order to predict to what extent the visual statistics of the
rearing environment affect surround modulation effects stimuli future
work should focus on generating image patterns from the input
statistics in order to see how strongly the effects can be modulated
when the statistics either match or clash with the statistics of the
rearing environment. If the statistics play a significant role then
matching the statistics should maximize the surround modulation
effects and result in a sparser representation. This may indeed be
sufficient to explain why the responses to natural images are sparser
than those for articifial stimuli.
