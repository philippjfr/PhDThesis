abstract = {Cortical neurons receive synaptic inputs from thousands of afferents that fire action potentials at rates ranging from less than 1 hertz to more than 200 hertz. Both the number of
afferents and their large dynamic range can mask changes in the spatial and temporal pattern of synaptic activity, limiting the ability of a cortical neuron to respond to its inputs. Modeling work based on experimental measurements indicates that short-term depression of intracortical synapses provides a dynamic gain-control mechanism that allows equal percentage rate changes on rapidly and slowly firing afferents to produce equal postsynaptic responses. Unlike inhibitory and adaptive mechanisms that reduce responsiveness to all inputs, synaptic depression is input-specific, leading to a dramatic increase in the sensitivity of a neuron to subtle changes in the firing patterns of its afferents.},

abstract = {The response of cortical neurons to a sensory stimulus is modulated by the context. In the visual cortex, for example, stimulation of a pyramidal cell's receptive-field surround can attenuate the cell's response to a stimulus in the centre of its receptive field, a phenomenon called surround suppression. Whether cortical circuits contribute to surround suppression or whether the phenomenon is entirely relayed from earlier stages of visual processing is debated. Here we show that, in contrast to pyramidal cells, the response of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons (SOMs) in the superficial layers of the mouse visual cortex increases with stimulation of the receptive-field surround. This difference results from the preferential excitation of SOMs by horizontal cortical axons. By perturbing the activity of SOMs, we show that these neurons contribute to pyramidal cells' surround suppression. These results establish a cortical circuit for surround suppression and attribute a particular function to a genetically defined type of inhibitory neuron.},

abstract = {Perceptual learning can be defined as practice-induced improvement in the ability to perform specific perceptual tasks. We previously proposed the Reverse Hierarchy Theory as a unifying concept that links behavioral findings of visual learning with physiological and anatomical data. Essentially, it asserts that learning is a top-down guided process, which begins at high-level areas of the visual system, and when these do not suffice, progresses backwards to the input levels, which have a better signal-to-noise ratio. This simple concept has proved powerful in explaining a broad range of findings, including seemingly contradicting data. We now extend this concept to describe the dynamics of skill acquisition and interpret recent behavioral and electrophysiological findings.},

@article{Albrecht2002,
abstract = {Cortical neurons display two fundamental nonlinear response characteristics: contrast-set gain control (also termed contrast normalization) and response expansion (also termed half-squaring). These nonlinearities could play an important role in forming and maintaining stimulus selectivity during natural viewing, but only if they operate well within the time frame of a single fixation. To analyze the temporal dynamics of these nonlinearities, we measured the responses of individual neurons, recorded from the primary visual cortex of monkeys and cats, as a function of the contrast of transient stationary gratings that were presented for a brief interval (200 ms). We then examined 1) the temporal response profile (i.e., the post stimulus time histogram) as a function of contrast and 2) the contrast response function throughout the course of the temporal response. We found that the shape and complexity of the temporal response profile varies considerably from cell to cell. However, within a given cell, the shape remains relatively invariant as a function of contrast and appears to be simply scaled and shifted. Stated quantitatively, approximately 95\% of the variation in the temporal responses as a function of contrast could be accounted for by scaling and shifting the average poststimulus time histogram. Equivalently, we found that the overall shape of the contrast response function (measured every 2 ms) remains relatively invariant from the onset through the entire temporal response. Further, the contrast-set gain control and the response expansion are fully expressed within the first 10 ms after the onset of the response. Stated quantitatively, the same, scaled Naka-Rushton equation (with the same half-saturation contrast and expansive response exponent) provides a good fit to the contrast response function from the first 10 ms through the last 10 ms of the temporal response. Based upon these measurements, it appears as though the two nonlinear properties, contrast-set gain control and response expansion, are present in full strength, virtually instantaneously, at the onset of the response. This observation suggests that response expansion and contrast-set gain control can influence the performance of visual cortex neurons very early in a single fixation, based on the contrast within that fixation. In the DISCUSSION, we consider the implications of the results within the context of 1) slower types of contrast gain control, 2) discrimination performance, 3) drifting steady-state measurements, 4) functional models that incorporate response expansion and contrast normalization, and 5) structural models of the biochemical and biophysical neural mechanisms.},

This form of suppression likely plays an important role in adjusting the gain of LGN responses to visual stimuli. We performed experiments in alert and anesthetized macaque monkies to quantify extraclassical suppression in the LGN and determine the roles of feedforward and feedback pathways in the generation of LGN suppression. Results show that suppression is significantly stronger among magnocellular neurons than parvocellular neurons and that suppression arises too quickly for involvement from cortical feedback. Furthermore, the amount of suppression supplied by the retina is not significantly different from that in the LGN. These results indicate that extraclassical suppression in the macaque LGN relies on feedforward mechanisms and suggest that suppression in the cortex likely includes a component established in the retina.},

We review evidence for and against this proposition and conclude that horizontal connections are too slow and cover too little visual field to subserve all the functions of suppressive surrounds of V1 neurons in the macaque monkey. We show that the extent of visual space covered by horizontal connections corresponds to the region of low contrast summation of the receptive field center mechanism. This region encompasses the classically defined receptive field center and the proximal surround. Beyond this region, feedback connections are the most likely substrate for surround suppression. We present evidence that inactivation of higher order areas leads to a major decrease in the strength of the suppressive surround of neurons in lower order areas, supporting the hypothesis that feedback connections play a major role in center-surround interactions.},

abstract = {Contrast-dependent changes in spatial summation and contextual modulation of primary visual cortex (V1) neuron responses to stimulation of their receptive field reveal long-distance integration of visual signals within V1, well beyond the classical receptive field (cRF) of single neurons. To identify the cortical circuits mediating these long-distance computations, we have used a combination of anatomical and physiological recording methods to determine the spatial scale and retinotopic logic of intra-areal V1 horizontal connections and inter-areal feedback connections to V1. We have then compared the spatial scales of these connectional systems to the spatial dimensions of the cRF, spatial summation field (SF), and modulatory surround field of macaque V1 neurons. We find that monosynaptic horizontal connections within area V1 are of an appropriate spatial scale to mediate interactions within the SF of V1 neurons and to underlie contrast-dependent changes in SF size. Contrary to common beliefs, these connections cannot fully account for the dimensions of the surround field. The spatial scale of feedback circuits from extrastriate cortex to V1 is, instead, commensurate with the full spatial range of center-surround interactions. Thus these connections could represent an anatomical substrate for contextual modulation and global-to-local integration of visual signals. Feedback projections connect corresponding and equal-sized regions of the visual field in striate and extrastriate cortices and cover anisotropic parts of visual space, unlike V1 horizontal connections that are isotropic in the macaque. V1 isotropic connectivity demonstrates that anisotropic horizontal connections are not necessary to generate orientation selectivity. Anisotropic feedback connections may play a role in contour completion.},

abstract = {Hubel and Wiesel (1962) classified primary visual cortex (V1) neurons as either simple, with responses modulated by the spatial phase of a sine grating, or complex, i.e., largely phase invariant. Much progress has been made in understanding how simple-cells develop, and there are now detailed computational models establishing how they can form topographic maps ordered by orientation preference. There are also models of how complex cells can develop using outputs from simple cells with different phase preferences, but no model of how a topographic orientation map of complex cells could be formed based on the actual connectivity patterns found in V1. Addressing this question is important, because the majority of existing developmental models of simple-cell maps group neurons selective to similar spatial phases together, which is contrary to experimental evidence, and makes it difficult to construct complex cells. Overcoming this limitation is not trivial, because mechanisms responsible for map development drive receptive fields (RF) of nearby neurons to be highly correlated, while co-oriented RFs of opposite phases are anti-correlated. In this work, we model V1 as two topographically organized sheets representing cortical layer 4 and 2/3. Only layer 4 receives direct thalamic input. Both sheets are connected with narrow feed-forward and feedback connectivity. Only layer 2/3 contains strong long-range lateral connectivity, in line with current anatomical findings. Initially all weights in the model are random, and each is modified via a Hebbian learning rule. The model develops smooth, matching, orientation preference maps in both sheets. Layer 4 units become simple cells, with phase preference arranged randomly, while those in layer 2/3 are primarily complex cells. To our knowledge this model is the first explaining how simple cells can develop with random phase preference, and how maps of complex cells can develop, using only realistic patterns of connectivity.},

To elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying contour and texture processing, we examined receptive field (RF) structures of neurons in visual area V2 of the macaque monkey for encoding combinations of orientations. By measuring orientation tuning at several locations within the classical RF, we found that a majority (70\%) of V2 neurons have similar orientation tuning throughout the RF. However, many others have RFs containing subregions tuned to different orientations, most commonly about 90 degrees apart. By measuring interactions between two positions within the RF, we found that approximately one-third of neurons show inhibitory interactions that make them selective for combinations of orientations. These results indicate that V2 neurons could play an important role in analyzing contours and textures and could provide useful cues for surface segmentation.},

abstract = {The response of cortical neurons to a sensory stimulus is shaped by the network in which they are embedded. Here we establish a role of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing cells, a large class of inhibitory neurons that target the soma and perisomatic compartments of pyramidal cells, in controlling cortical responses. By bidirectionally manipulating PV cell activity in visual cortex we show that these neurons strongly modulate layer 2/3 pyramidal cell spiking responses to visual stimuli while only modestly affecting their tuning properties. PV cells' impact on pyramidal cells is captured by a linear transformation, both additive and multiplicative, with a threshold. These results indicate that PV cells are ideally suited to modulate cortical gain and establish a causal relationship between a select neuron type and specific computations performed by the cortex during sensory processing.},

@article{Ayaz2013,
abstract = {Growing evidence indicates that responses in sensory cortex are modulated by factors beyond direct sensory stimulation [1-8]. In primary visual cortex (V1), for instance, responses increase with locomotion [9, 10]. Here we show that this increase is accompanied by a profound change in spatial integration. We recorded from V1 neurons in head-fixed mice placed on a spherical treadmill. We characterized spatial integration and found that the responses of most neurons were suppressed by large stimuli. As in primates [11, 12], this surround suppression increased with stimulus contrast. These effects were captured by a divisive normalization model [13, 14], where the numerator originates from a central region driving the neuron and the denominator originates from a larger suppressive field. We then studied the effects of locomotion and found that it markedly reduced surround suppression, allowing V1 neurons to integrate over larger regions of visual space. Locomotion had two main effects: it increased spontaneous activity, and it weakened the suppressive signals mediating normalization, relative to the driving signals. We conclude that a fundamental aspect of visual processing, spatial integration, is controlled by an apparently unrelated factor, locomotion. This control might operate through the mechanisms that are in place to deliver surround suppression.},

This includes the distinction and hierarchy between simple and complex cells, the mechanisms underlying the receptive field surround, and debates about optimal stimuli for mapping receptive fields. An important new problem arises from recent observations of stimulus-dependent spatial and temporal summation in primary visual cortex.

@article{Bair2003,
abstract = {Iso-orientation surround suppression is a powerful form of visual contextual modulation in which a stimulus of the preferred orientation of a neuron placed outside the classical receptive field (CRF) of the neuron suppresses the response to stimuli within the CRF. This suppression is most often attributed to orientation-tuned signals that propagate laterally across the cortex, activating local inhibition. By studying the temporal properties of surround suppression, we have uncovered characteristics that challenge standard notions of surround suppression. We found that the latency of suppression depended on its strength. Across cells, strong suppression arrived on average 30 msec earlier than weak suppression, and suppression sometimes arrived faster than the excitatory CRF response. We compared the relative latency of CRF response onset and offset with the relative latency of suppression onset and offset. Response onset was delayed relative to response offset in the CRF but not in the surround. This is not the expected result if neurons targeted by suppression are like those that generate it. We examined the time course of suppression as a function of distance of the surround stimulus from the CRF and found that suppression was predominantly sustained for nearby stimuli and predominantly transient for distant stimuli. By comparing the latency of suppression for nearby and distant stimuli, we found that orientation-tuned suppression could effectively propagate across 6 - 8 mm of cortex at approximately 1 m/sec. This is considerably faster than expected for horizontal cortical connections previously implicated in surround suppression. We offer refinements to circuits for surround suppression that account for these results and describe how feedback from cells with large CRFs can account for the rapid propagation of suppression within V1.},

@article{Baker1998,
abstract = {We have examined the spatial-frequency selectivity of neurons in areas 17 and 18 of the adult pigmented ferret, by measuring how the amplitude of response depends on the spatial-frequency of moving sinusoidal gratings of optimal orientation and fixed contrast. Neurons in area 17 of the ferret respond optimally to low spatial frequencies [average 0.25 cycles per degree (c/deg)], much lower than the optima for cat area 17. The tuning curves are of the same form as those found in cat and monkey: unimodal with bandwidths in the range 0.8-3.5 octaves. Neurons in area 18 of the ferret respond optimally to even lower spatial frequencies (average 0.087 c/deg) than area 17 neurons, and the distributions of optimal spatial frequency for areas 17 and 18 hardly overlap. In both cortical areas, the bandwidth of the tuning curves is inversely correlated with optimal spatial frequency. This marked difference in tuning between the two cortical areas is probably attributable to differential geniculo-cortical projections. Small injections of fluorescent latex microspheres or horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were made into area 17 or area 18 in order to investigate the populations of geniculate neurons projecting to the two cortical areas. After injections into area 17, labelled neurons are found predominantly in the geniculate A layers, with a few neurons labelled in the C layers. Conversely, after an area 18 injection, similar numbers of labelled neurons are found in the C layers as in the A layers. Soma-size analysis of the neurons in the A-layers suggests the existence of two populations of relay neurons, which project differentially to areas 17 and 18. The different geniculate inputs and the different spatial-frequency tuning in areas 17 and 18 may imply that the two cortical areas process visual information more in parallel than in series.},

abstract = {Visual deprivation is reported to prevent or delay the development of mature receptive field (RF) properties in primary visual cortex (V1) in several species. In contrast, visual deprivation neither prevents nor delays refinement of RF size in the superior colliculus (SC) of Syrian hamsters, although vision is required for RF maintenance in the SC. Here, we report that, contrary to expectation, visual cortical RF refinement occurs normally in dark-reared animals. As in the SC, a brief period of visual experience is required to maintain V1 RF refinement in adulthood. Whereas in the SC, 3 days of visual experience within a sensitive period (P37-40) was sufficient to protect RFs from deprivation-induced enlargement in adulthood, 7 days (P33-40) were required for RF size maintenance in V1. Thus, spontaneous activity is sufficient for RF refinement at these 2 levels of the visual pathway, and visual input is necessary only to prevent deprivation-induced RF enlargement in adulthood. These studies show that sensory experience during a late juvenile sensitive period protects the visual pathway against sensory deprivation in adulthood, and suggest that more importance may have been placed on the role of early visual experience in visual RF development than is warranted.},

abstract = {Chronic changes in neuronal activity homeostatically regulate excitatory circuitry. However, little is known about how activity regulates inhibitory circuits or specific inhibitory neuron types. Here, we examined the activity-dependent regulation of two neocortical inhibitory circuits--parvalbumin-positive (Parv+) and somatostatin-positive (Som+)--using paired recordings of synaptically coupled neurons. Action potentials were blocked for 5 days in slice culture, and unitary synaptic connections among inhibitory/excitatory neuron pairs were examined. Chronic activity blockade caused similar and distinct changes between the two inhibitory circuits. First, increases in intrinsic membrane excitability and excitatory synaptic drive in both inhibitory subtypes were consistent with the homeostatic regulation of firing rate of these neurons. On the other hand, inhibitory synapses originating from these two subtypes were differentially regulated by activity blockade. Parv+ unitary inhibitory postsynaptic current (uIPSC) strength was decreased while Som+ uIPSC strength was unchanged. Using short-duration stimulus trains, short-term plasticity for both unitary excitatory postsynaptic current (uEPSCs) and uIPSCs was unchanged in Parv+ circuitry while distinctively altered in Som+ circuitry--uEPSCs became less facilitating and uIPSCs became more depressing. In the context of recurrent inhibition, these changes would result in a frequency-dependent shift in the relative influence of each circuit. The functional changes at both types of inhibitory connections appear to be mediated by increases in presynaptic release probability and decreases in synapse number. Interestingly, these opposing changes result in decreased Parv+-mediated uIPSCs but balance out to maintain normal Som+-mediated uIPSCs. In summary, these results reveal that inhibitory circuitry is not uniformly regulated by activity levels and may provide insight into the mechanisms of both normal and pathological neocortical plasticity.},

We tested the rule of good continuation by stimulating behaving monkeys with simple figures composed of Gabor patches, while recording from upper layer cells in visual cortex (V1). By decomposing these figures into their components and stimulating receptive field centers and surrounds separately with this stimulus set, we tested center-surround interaction for linearity. In pure-fixation tasks, the interaction was negative for the early strong evoked response, i.e., in this phase figural context rather inhibited the cells. However, in the following tonic response phase, a subgroup of neurons showed positive interaction during the whole stimulus presentation period of at least 1,000 ms. Attention to the figure in discrimination tasks only slightly improved this positive interaction between 150 and 300 ms. We interpret these results as selective cooperation and mutual facilitation of cortical V1 cells, thereby supporting the saliency of borders and contours in perception of visual scenes.},

The same self-organizing processes that are responsible for the long-term development of the map are shown to result in tilt aftereffects over short timescales in the adult. The model permits simultaneous observation of large numbers of neurons and connections, making it possible to relate high-level phenomena to low-level events, which is difficult to do experimentally. The results give detailed computational support for the long-standing conjecture that the direct tilt aftereffect arises from adaptive lateral interactions between feature detectors. They also make a new prediction that the indirect effect results from the normalization of synaptic efficacies during this process. The model thus provides a unified computational explanation of self-organization and both the direct and indirect tilt aftereffect in the primary visual cortex.},

abstract = {Researchers have used a very wide range of different experimental and theoretical approaches to help understand mammalian visual systems. These approaches tend to have quite different assumptions, strengths, and weaknesses. Computational models of the visual cortex, in particular, have typically implemented either a proposed circuit for part of the visual cortex of the adult, assuming a very specific wiring pattern based on findings from adults, or else attempted to explain the long-term development of a visual cortex region from an initially undifferentiated starting point. Previous models of adult V1 have been able to account for many of the measured properties of V1 neurons, while not explaining how these properties arise or why neurons have those properties in particular. Previous developmental models have been able to reproduce the overall organization of specific feature maps in V1, such as orientation maps, but are generally formulated at an abstract level that does not allow testing with real images or analysis of detailed neural properties relevant for visual function. In this review of results from a large set of new, integrative models developed from shared principles and a set of shared software components, I show how these models now represent a single, consistent explanation for a wide body of experimental evidence, and form a compact hypothesis for much of the development and behavior of neurons in the visual cortex. The models are the first developmental models with wiring consistent with V1, the first to have realistic behavior with respect to visual contrast, and the first to include all of the demonstrated visual feature dimensions. The goal is to have a comprehensive explanation for why V1 is wired as it is in the adult, and how that circuitry leads to the observed behavior of the neurons during visual tasks.},

abstract = {Newborn humans preferentially orient to facelike patterns at birth, but months of experience with faces are required for full face processing abilities to develop. Several models have been proposed for how the interaction of genetic and environmental influences can explain these data. These models generally assume that the brain areas responsible for newborn orienting responses are not capable of learning and are physically separate from those that later learn from real faces. However, it has been difficult to reconcile these models with recent discoveries of face learning in newborns and young infants. We propose a general mechanism by which genetically specified and environment-driven preferences can coexist in the same visual areas. In particular, newborn face orienting may be the result of prenatal exposure of a learning system to internally generated input patterns, such as those found in PGO waves during REM sleep. Simulating this process with the HLISSOM biological model of the visual system, we demonstrate that the combination of learning and internal patterns is an efficient way to specify and develop circuitry for face perception. This prenatal learning can account for the newborn preferences for schematic and photographic images of faces, providing a computational explanation for how genetic influences interact with experience to construct a complex adaptive system.},

abstract = {Normal operations of the neocortex depend critically on several types of inhibitory interneurons, but the specific function of each type is unknown. One possibility is that interneurons are differentially engaged by patterns of activity that vary in frequency and timing. To explore this, we studied the strength and short-term dynamics of chemical synapses interconnecting local excitatory neurons (regular-spiking, or RS, cells) with two types of inhibitory interneurons: fast-spiking (FS) cells, and low-threshold spiking (LTS) cells of layer 4 in the rat barrel cortex. We also tested two other pathways onto the interneurons: thalamocortical connections and recurrent collaterals from corticothalamic projection neurons of layer 6. The excitatory and inhibitory synapses interconnecting RS cells and FS cells were highly reliable in response to single stimuli and displayed strong short-term depression. In contrast, excitatory and inhibitory synapses interconnecting the RS and LTS cells were less reliable when initially activated. Excitatory synapses from RS cells onto LTS cells showed dramatic short-term facilitation, whereas inhibitory synapses made by LTS cells onto RS cells facilitated modestly or slightly depressed. Thalamocortical inputs strongly excited both RS and FS cells but rarely and only weakly contacted LTS cells. Both types of interneurons were strongly excited by facilitating synapses from axon collaterals of corticothalamic neurons. We conclude that there are two parallel but dynamically distinct systems of synaptic inhibition in layer 4 of neocortex, each defined by its intrinsic spiking properties, the short-term plasticity of its chemical synapses, and (as shown previously) an exclusive set of electrical synapses. Because of their unique dynamic properties, each inhibitory network will be recruited by different temporal patterns of cortical activity.},

abstract = {While it is widely assumed that the long-range horizontal connections in V1 are present to support contour integration, there has been only limited consideration of other possible relationships between anatomy and physiology (the horizontal connections) and visual function beyond contour integration. We introduce the possibility of other relationships directly from the perspective of computation and differential geometry by identifying orientation columns in visual physiology with the (unit) tangent bundle in differential geometry. This suggests abstracting early vision in a space that incorporates both position and orientation, from which we show that the physiology is capable of supporting a number of functional computations beyond contour integration, including texture-flow and shading-flow integration, as well as certain relationships between them. The geometric abstraction emphasizes the role of curvature, which necessitates a coupled investigation into how it might be estimated. The result is an elaboration of layer-to-layer interactions within an orientation column, with non-linearities possibly implemented by shunting inhibition. Finally, we show how the same computational framework naturally lends itself to solving stereo correspondence, with binocular tangents abstracting curves in space.},

Such photic entrainment requires neither rods nor cones, the only known retinal photoreceptors. Here, we show that retinal ganglion cells innervating the SCN are intrinsically photosensitive. Unlike other ganglion cells, they depolarized in response to light even when all synaptic input from rods and cones was blocked. The sensitivity, spectral tuning, and slow kinetics of this light response matched those of the photic entrainment mechanism, suggesting that these ganglion cells may be the primary photoreceptors for this system.},

abstract = {Acetylcholine is an important neuromodulator involved in cognitive function. The impact of cholinergic neuromodulation on computations within the cortical microcircuit is not well understood. Here we investigate the effects of layer-specific cholinergic drug application in the tree shrew primary visual cortex during visual stimulation with drifting grating stimuli of varying contrast and orientation. We describe differences between muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic effects in terms of both the layer of cortex and the attribute of visual representation. Nicotinic receptor activation enhanced the contrast response in the granular input layer of the cortex, while tending to reduce neural selectivity for orientation across all cortical layers. Muscarinic activation modestly enhanced the contrast response across cortical layers, and tended to improve orientation tuning. This resulted in highest orientation selectivity in the supra- and infragranular layers, where orientation selectivity was already greatest in the absence of pharmacological stimulation. Our results indicate that laminar position plays a crucial part in functional consequences of cholinergic stimulation, consistent with the differential distribution of cholinergic receptors. Nicotinic receptors function to enhance sensory representations arriving in the cortex, whereas muscarinic receptors act to boost the cortical computation of orientation tuning. Our findings suggest close homology between cholinergic mechanisms in tree shrew and primate visual cortices.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The basal forebrain (BF) regulates cortical activity by the action of cholinergic projections to the cortex. At the same time, it also sends substantial GABAergic projections to both cortex and thalamus, whose functional role has received far less attention. We used deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the BF, which is thought to activate both types of projections, to investigate the impact of BF activation on V1 neural activity. RESULTS: BF stimulation robustly increased V1 single and multi-unit activity, led to moderate decreases in orientation selectivity and a remarkable increase in contrast sensitivity as demonstrated by a reduced semi-saturation contrast. The spontaneous V1 local field potential often exhibited spectral peaks centered at 40 and 70Hz as well as reliably showed a broad gamma-band (30-90Hz) increase following BF stimulation, whereas effects in a low frequency band (1-10Hz) were less consistent. The broad gamma-band, rather than low frequency activity or spectral peaks was the best predictor of both the firing rate increase and contrast sensitivity increase of V1 unit activity. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that BF activation has a strong influence on contrast sensitivity in V1. We suggest that, in addition to cholinergic modulation, the BF GABAergic projections play a crucial role in the impact of BF DBS on cortical activity.},

abstract = {The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the mouse has emerged as a model system in the study of thalamic circuit development. However, there is still a lack of information regarding how and when various types of retinal and nonretinal synapses develop. We examined the synaptic organization of the developing mouse dLGN in the common pigmented C57/BL6 strain, by recording the synaptic responses evoked by electrical stimulation of optic tract axons, and by investigating the ultrastructure of identified synapses. At early postnatal ages (<P12), optic tract evoked responses were primarily excitatory. The full complement of inhibitory responses did not emerge until after eye opening (>P14), when optic tract stimulation routinely evoked an excitatory postsynaptic potential/inhibitory postsynaptic potential (EPSP/IPSP) sequence, with the latter having both a GABA(A) and GABA(B) component. Electrophysiological and ultrastructural observations were consistent. At P7, many synapses were present, but synaptic profiles lacked the ultrastructural features characteristic of the adult dLGN, and little gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) could be detected by using immunocytochemical techniques. In contrast, by P14, GABA staining was robust, mature synaptic profiles of retinal and nonretinal origin were easily distinguished, and the size and proportion of synaptic contacts were similar to those of the adult. The emergence of nonretinal synapses coincides with pruning of retinogeniculate connections, and the transition of retinal activity from spontaneous to visually driven. These results indicate that the synaptic architecture of the mouse dLGN is similar to that of other higher mammals, and thus provides further support for its use as a model system for visual system development.},

To achieve this, we made three-dimensional reconstructions of 39 single neurons and thalamic afferents labeled with horseradish peroxidase during intracellular recordings in vivo. These neurons served as representatives of the different types and provided the morphometrical data about the laminar distribution of the dendritic trees and synaptic boutons and the number of synapses formed by a given type of neuron. Extensive searches of the literature provided the estimates of numbers of the different neuronal types and their distribution across the cortical layers. Applying the simplification that synapses between different cell types are made in proportion to the boutons and dendrites that those cell types contribute to the neuropil in a given layer, we were able to estimate the probable source and number of synapses made between neurons in the six layers. The predicted synaptic maps were quantitatively close to the estimates derived from the experimental electron microscopic studies for the case of the main sources of excitatory and inhibitory input to the spiny stellate cells, which form a major target of layer 4 afferents. The map of the whole cortical circuit shows that there are very few "strong" but many "weak" excitatory projections, each of which may involve only a few percentage of the total complement of excitatory synapses of a single neuron.},

Where their scales overlap, these organizations interact; iso-orientation contours cross ocular dominance columns at right angles, and ocular dominance columns distort retinotopy near the V1/V2 border. To explore these interactions, we developed an optical technique for visualizing retinotopy in vivo that allows us to analyze it in relation to ocular dominance and orientation patterns. Our results show local retinotopic distortions in every region of macaque V1 that we examine, including regions far from the V1/V2 border. They also show a consistent relation between local axes of distortion and ocular dominance slabs, which they intersect at angles of approximately 90 degrees. A further correlation is provided by retinotopic maps from New World primates that show less distortion (9 vs 60\%) in two species characterized by an absence of pronounced ocular dominance columns. Retinotopic maps from these New World primates also revealed an unexpected tilt of the vertical midline representation that diverged from the V1/V2 border by an angle of approximately 20 degrees. Overall, these results suggest a general tendency for slab-based organizations to distort retinotopy by representing the same part of space more than once in adjacent slabs.},

Perhaps the biggest impediment to understanding these networks is that we have no wiring diagrams of their interconnections. Even if we had a partial or complete wiring diagram, however, understanding the network would also require information about each neuron's function. Here we show that the relationship between structure and function can be studied in the cortex with a combination of in vivo physiology and network anatomy. We used two-photon calcium imaging to characterize a functional property--the preferred stimulus orientation--of a group of neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex. Large-scale electron microscopy of serial thin sections was then used to trace a portion of these neurons' local network. Consistent with a prediction from recent physiological experiments, inhibitory interneurons received convergent anatomical input from nearby excitatory neurons with a broad range of preferred orientations, although weak biases could not be rejected.},

abstract = {We recently demonstrated with magnetoencephalographic recordings in human observers that the focus of attention in visual search has a spatial profile consisting of a center enhancement surrounded by a narrow zone of sensory attenuation. Here, we report new data from 2 experiments providing insights into the cortical processes that cause the surround attenuation. We show that surround suppression appears in search tasks that require spatial scrutiny, that is the precise binding of search-relevant features at the target's location but not in tasks that permit target discrimination without precise localization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that surround attenuation is linked with a stronger recurrent activity modulation in early visual cortex. Finally, we show that surround suppression appears with a delay (more than 175 ms) that is beyond the time course of the initial feedforward sweep of processing in the visual system. These observations together indicate that the suppressive surround is associated with recurrent processing and binding in the visual cortex.},

abstract = {The responses of neurons in lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) exhibit powerful suppressive phenomena such as contrast saturation, size tuning, and masking. These phenomena cannot be explained by the classical center-surround receptive field and have been ascribed to a variety of mechanisms, including feedback from cortex. We asked whether these phenomena might all be explained by a single mechanism, contrast gain control, which is inherited from retina and possibly strengthened in thalamus. We formalized an intuitive model of retinal contrast gain control that explicitly predicts gain as a function of local contrast. In the model, the output of the receptive field is divided by the output of a suppressive field, which computes the local root-mean-square contrast. The model provides good fits to LGN responses to a variety of stimuli; with a single set of parameters, it captures saturation, size tuning, and masking. It also correctly predicts that responses to small stimuli grow proportionally with contrast: were it not for the suppressive field, LGN responses would be linear. We characterized the suppressive field and found that it is similar in size to the surround of the classical receptive field (which is eight times larger than commonly estimated), it is not selective for stimulus orientation, and it responds to a wide range of frequencies, including very low spatial frequencies and high temporal frequencies. The latter property is hardly consistent with feedback from cortex. These measurements thoroughly describe the visual properties of contrast gain control in LGN and provide a parsimonious explanation for disparate suppressive phenomena.},

abstract = {Fly motion vision and resultant compensatory optomotor responses are a classic example for neural computation. Here we review our current understanding of processing of optic flow as generated by an animal's self-motion. Optic flow processing is accomplished in a series of steps: First, the time-varying photoreceptor signals are fed into a two-dimensional array of Reichardt-type elementary motion detectors (EMDs). EMDs compute, in parallel, local motion vectors at each sampling point in space. Second, the output signals of many EMDs are spatially integrated on the dendrites of large-field tangential cells in the lobula plate. In the third step, tangential cells form extensive interactions with each other, giving rise to their large and complex receptive fields. Thus, tangential cells can act as matched filters tuned to optic flow during particular flight maneuvers. They finally distribute their information onto postsynaptic descending neurons, which either instruct the motor centers of the thoracic ganglion for flight and locomotion control or act themselves as motor neurons that control neck muscles for head movements.},

abstract = {Horizontal connections, formed primarily by the axon collaterals of pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 of visual cortex, extend for millimeters parallel to the cortical surface and form patchy terminations. Previous studies have provided evidence that the patches formed by horizontal connections exhibit modular specificity, preferentially linking columns of neurons with similar response characteristics, such as preferred orientation. The issue of how these connections are distributed with respect to the topographic map of visual space, however, has not been resolved. Here we combine optical imaging of intrinsic signals with small extracellular injections of biocytin to assess quantitatively the specificity of horizontal connections with respect to both the map of orientation preference and the map of visual space in tree shrew V1. Our results indicate that horizontal connections outside a radius of 500 microm from the injection site exhibit not only modular specificity, but also specificity for axis of projection. Labeled axons extend for longer distances, and give off more terminal boutons, along an axis in the map of visual space that corresponds to the preferred orientation of the injection site. Inside of 500 microm, the pattern of connections is much less specific, with boutons found along every axis, contacting sites with a wide range of preferred orientations. The system of long-range horizontal connections can be summarized as preferentially linking neurons with co-oriented, co-axially aligned receptive fields. These observations suggest specific ways that horizontal circuits contribute to the response properties of layer 2/3 neurons and to mechanisms of visual perception.},

abstract = {Somewhere between the retina and our conscious visual experience, the majority of the information impinging on the eye is lost. We are typically aware of only either the most salient parts of a visual scene or the parts that we are actively paying attention to. Recent research on visual neurons in monkeys is beginning to show how the brain both selects and discards incoming visual information. For example, what happens to the responses of visual neurons when attention is directed to one element, such as an oriented colored bar, embedded among an array of other oriented bars? Some of this research shows that attention to the oriented bar restricts the receptive field of visual neurons down to this single element. However, other research shows that attention to this single element affects the responses of neurons with receptive fields throughout the visual field. In this review, these two seemingly contradictory results are shown to actually be mutually consistent. A simple computational model is described that explains these results, and also provides a framework for predicting a variety of additional neurophysiological, neuroimaging and behavioral studies of attention.},

abstract = {Spatial frequency tuning in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1) differ substantially. LGN responses are largely low-pass in spatial frequency, whereas the majority of V1 neurons have bandpass characteristics. To study this transformation in spatial selectivity, we measured the dynamics of spatial frequency tuning using a reverse correlation technique. We find that a large proportion of V1 cells show inseparable responses in spatial frequency and time. In several cases, tuning becomes more selective over the course of the response, and the preferred spatial frequency shifts from low to higher frequencies. Many responses also show suppression at low spatial frequencies, which correlates with the increases in response selectivity and the shifts of preferred spatial frequency. These results indicate that suppression plays an important role in the generation of bandpass selectivity in V1.},

The analysis of neuronal connectivity is possible with electron microscopy, but technological limitations have impeded the acquisition of high-resolution data on a large enough scale. Here we show, using serial block-face electron microscopy and two-photon calcium imaging, that the dendrites of mouse starburst amacrine cells make highly specific synapses with direction-selective ganglion cells depending on the ganglion cell's preferred direction. Our findings indicate that a structural (wiring) asymmetry contributes to the computation of direction selectivity. The nature of this asymmetry supports some models of direction selectivity and rules out others. It also puts constraints on the developmental mechanisms behind the formation of synaptic connections. Our study demonstrates how otherwise intractable neurobiological questions can be addressed by combining functional imaging with the analysis of neuronal connectivity using large-scale electron microscopy.},

abstract = {Most neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) are selective for stimulus size, a property with important implications for salient feature detection. Size selectivity involves dynamic interactions between neuronal circuits that establish the classical (center) and extraclassical (surround) of a neuron's receptive field. Although much is known about the tuning properties and stimulus selectivity of the center and surround subunits, relatively little is known about how these subunits interact to achieve size selectivity. To address this question, we examined the temporal dynamics of size selectivity in two classes of pyramidal neurons at similar hierarchical processing stages in V1 of alert monkeys. These two classes were comprised of neurons in cortical layer 6 with identified projections to the lateral geniculate nucleus. While both neuronal groups displayed comparable levels of size selectivity, the temporal dynamics of their tuning differed significantly. We compared the size tuning profiles of each cell type with a series of sum-of-Gaussian models and discovered that the receptive fields of neurons with fast-conducting axons contained an excitatory center and a suppressive surround with similar onset timing. In contrast, neurons with slow-conducting axons used two center components-an early wide-field component and a delayed narrow-field component that increased activity-in addition to the surround component. The early, wide-field component represents a novel mechanism for cortical neurons to integrate contextual information. These results demonstrate that size tuning in cortical neurons is established via multiple unique mechanisms, dictated by the rich circuit architecture in which neurons are embedded.},

abstract = {We have previously documented the exquisite motion sensitivity of neurons in extrastriate area MT by studying the relationship between their responses and the direction and strength of visual motion signals delivered to their receptive fields. These results suggested that MT neurons might provide the signals supporting behavioral choice in visual discrimination tasks. To approach this question from another direction, we have now studied the relationship between the discharge of MT neurons and behavioral choice, independently of the effects of visual stimulation. We found that trial-to-trial variability in neuronal signals was correlated with the choices the monkey made. Therefore, when a directionally selective neuron in area MT fires more vigorously, the monkey is more likely to make a decision in favor of the preferred direction of the cell. The magnitude of the relationship was modest, on average, but was highly significant across a sample of 299 cells from four monkeys. The relationship was present for all stimuli (including those without a net motion signal), and for all but the weakest responses. The relationship was reduced or eliminated when the demands of the task were changed so that the directional signal carried by the cell was less informative. The relationship was evident within 50 ms of response onset, and persisted throughout the stimulus presentation. On average, neurons that were more sensitive to weak motion signals had a stronger relationship to behavior than those that were less sensitive. These observations are consistent with the idea that neuronal signals in MT are used by the monkey to determine the direction of stimulus motion. The modest relationship between behavioral choice and the discharge of any one neuron, and the prevalence of the relationship across the population, make it likely that signals from many neurons are pooled to form the data on which behavioral choices are based.},

Ignoring variations in spike amplitude and shape that are probably not meaningful to a receiving cell, the information content, or entropy of the signal depends on only the timing of action potentials, and because there is no external clock, only the interspike intervals, and not the absolute spike times, are significant. Estimating spike train entropy is a difficult task, particularly with small data sets, and many methods of entropy estimation have been proposed. Here we present two related model-based methods for estimating the entropy of neural signals and compare them to existing methods. One of the methods is fast and reasonably accurate, and it converges well with short spike time records; the other is impractically time-consuming but apparently very accurate, relying on generating artificial data that are a statistical match to the experimental data. Using the slow, accurate method to generate a best-estimate entropy value, we find that the faster estimator converges to this value more closely and with smaller data sets than many existing entropy estimators.},

abstract = {In the absence of a direct and specific marker for basket cells, the aim of this paper was to use available data to estimate the density of basket cell synaptic input to smooth and spiny neurons within layer IV of cat striate visual cortex (area 17). A linear quantitative analysis of layer IV basket cell connectivity data suggests that on average basket cells (1) comprise 25-35\% of all GABAergic neurons in layer IV (3552-4736 cells mm(-3)), (2) account for 30-41\% of all putative inhibitory dendritic synapses of layer IV spiny stellate cells (145-195 synapses cell(-1)) and a similar proportion of layer IV basket cells (25-37\%, 71-107 synapses cell(-1)), and (3) provide each layer IV spiny cell with 13-45 axons and each layer IV basket cell with 6-29 axons. These estimates suggest that basket cells may be less common and provide a smaller proportion of the dendritic synaptic input to layer IV spiny and smooth neurons than previously thought. In addition, the analysis indicates that a layer IV spiny stellate cell may receive on average as many synapses and axons from layer IV basket cells as from lateral geniculate relay cells. Based on this potential numerical similarity, a geniculate-basket synaptic pairing in a spine-shaft microcircuit is hypothesized. This microcircuit could implement a type of local (dendritic) push-pull interaction underlying subfield antagonism.},

abstract = {Cortical processing of visual information requires that information be exchanged between neurons coding for distant regions in the visual field. It is argued that feedback connections are the best candidates for such rapid long-distance interconnections. In the integrated model, information arriving in the cortex from the magnocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus is first sent and processed in the parietal cortex that is very rapidly activated by a visual stimulus. Results from this first-pass computation are then sent back by feedback connections to areas V1 and V2 that act as 'active black-boards' for the rest of the visual cortical areas: information retroinjected from the parietal cortex is used to guide further processing of parvocellular and koniocellular information in the inferotemporal cortex.},

abstract = {The results of a previous study [Hup\'{e} et al. (1998) Nature, 394: 784–787] led us to conclude that feedback connections are important for differentiating a figure from the background, particularly in the case of low salience stimuli. This conclusion was principally based on the observation in area V3 neurons that inactivating MT by cooling led to a severe weakening of the center response and of the center-surround interactions, and that these effects were particularly strong for low salience stimuli. In the present paper, we first show that the results extend to areas V1 and V2. In particular, the inhibitory center-surround interactions in areas V1, V2 and V3 disappear almost completely in the absence of feedback input from MT for low salience stimuli, whereas the effects are much more limited for stimuli of middle and high salience. We then compare the results obtained in studies of feedback connections from MT to those obtained in a study of the feedback action of area V2 onto V1 neurons [Hup\'{e} et al. (2001) J. Neurophysiol., 85: 146–163], in which the same effects were observed on the center mechanism (decrease in response), but no effects were seen on the center-surround interactions. We conclude that feedback connections act in a non-linear fashion to boost the gain of the center mechanism and that they combine with horizontal connections to generate the center-surround interactions.},

abstract = {Cortical computations are critically dependent on GABA-releasing neurons for dynamically balancing excitation with inhibition that is proportional to the overall level of activity. Although it is widely accepted that there are multiple types of interneurons, defining their identities based on qualitative descriptions of morphological, molecular and physiological features has failed to produce a universally accepted 'parts list', which is needed to understand the roles that interneurons play in cortical processing. A list of features has been published by the Petilla Interneurons Nomenclature Group, which represents an important step toward an unbiased classification of interneurons. To this end some essential features have recently been studied quantitatively and their association was examined using multidimensional cluster analyses. These studies revealed at least 3 distinct electrophysiological, 6 morphological and 15 molecular phenotypes. This is a conservative estimate of the number of interneuron types, which almost certainly will be revised as more quantitative studies will be performed and similarities will be defined objectively. It is clear that interneurons are organized with physiological attributes representing the most general, molecular characteristics the most detailed and morphological features occupying the middle ground. By themselves, none of these features are sufficient to define classes of interneurons. The challenge will be to determine which features belong together and how cell type-specific feature combinations are genetically specified.},

abstract = {The axonal (bouton) distributions of a layer 4 clutch cell (CC), two layer 3 medium-sized basket cells (MBC), and a layer 3 large basket cell (LBC) to orientation, direction, and ocular dominance maps were studied quantitatively. 1) The CC provided exclusively local projections (<380 microm from the soma) and contacted a narrow "niche" of functional representations. 2) The two MBCs emitted local projections (75\% and 79\% of all boutons), which were engaged with isoorientations (61\% and 48\%) and isodirections, and long-range projections (25\% and 21\%, >313 microm and >418 microm), which encountered cross-orientation sites (14\% and 12\%) and isoorientation sites (7\% and 5\%). Their direction preferences were mainly perpendicular to or opposite those of local projections. 3) The LBC provided the majority (60\%) of its boutons to long-range distances (>437 microm). Locally, LBC boutons showed a rather balanced contribution to isoorientations (19\%) and cross-orientations (12\%) and preferred isodirections. Remotely, however, cross-orientation sites were preferred (31\% vs. 23\%) and the directional output was balanced. 4) Monte Carlo simulations revealed that the differences between the orientation specificity of local and long-range projections cannot be explained by a homogeneous lateral distribution of the boutons. 5) There was a similar eye preference in the local and long-range projection fields of the MBCs. The LBC contacted both contra- and ipsilateral eye domains. 6) The basket axons showed little laminar difference in orientation and direction topography. The results suggest that an individual basket cell can mediate a wide range of effects depending on the size and termination pattern of the axonal field.},

abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated that axonal arbors specific for the four main cortical layers - 2/3, 4, 5, and 6 - develop precisely from the outset using activity-independent cues. In macaque primary visual cortex (V1), layer 2/3 is subdivided into layers named 2/3A, 3B, 4A, and 4B, and layer 4 is subdivided into 4Calpha and 4Cbeta. Individual neurons in V1 of mature macaques have axonal arbors that are highly specific for these sublayers. We have studied the prenatal development of laminar and sublaminar specificity of local circuits in macaque V1. Two-hundred thirty-eight neurons were labeled intracellularly in living brain slices prepared from V1 of five prenatal macaque monkeys aged 100 to 145 d postconception (E100-E145). Axonal and dendritic arbors of labeled neurons were reconstructed to assess their relationships to the cortical layers. We find that developing spiny neurons in layers 2-4B and layer 5 specifically target superficial and deep layers without forming "incorrect" branches in layer 4C. Similarly, layer 6 pyramidal neurons that target layer 4C do not form "incorrect" branches in layer 5. These results indicate that specific projections to the main cortical layers develop with a high degree of selectivity, as in other species. However, the development of sublayer-specific projections was not always precise from the outset. Unlike postnatal animals, axons of some prenatal layer 4Cbeta spiny neurons branch in layer 4B. At similar ages, many pyramidal neurons in the upper half of layer 6 have axonal branches in layer 4Calpha as well as 4Cbeta; these projections are specific for 4Cbeta in more mature animals. Also, there is similar "exuberance" in axonal arbors of other layer 6 cell types. Transient projections were also observed in the subplate and to the white matter for cells from all layers, except 4Cbeta. These observations indicate that at least some sublayer-specific projections emerge by elimination of exuberant axonal branches and suggest that they may use activity-dependent mechanisms to identify "correct" target layers. Such cues could be provided by laminar differences in the patterns of spontaneous prenatal activity in the retino-geniculo-cortical network.},

Making sense of the functions of these circuits from anatomical observations requires linking these circuits to function at each of these levels of complexity. Observations of these relationships have become increasingly sophisticated over the last several decades, beginning with correlations between the connectivities and functions of various visual cortical areas and progressing toward cell type-specificity. These studies have informed current views about the functional interactions between cortical areas and modules and the mechanisms by which fine scale microcircuits influence interactions at more coarse levels of organization. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This alignment facilitates coherent integration of different categories of sensory inputs and allows for proper sensorimotor transformations. Topographic maps are established and aligned by multistep processes during development, including interactions of molecular guidance cues expressed in gradients; spontaneous activity-dependent axonal and dendritic remodeling; and sensory-evoked plasticity driven by experience. By focusing on the superior colliculus, a major site of topographic map alignment for different sensory modalities, this review summarizes current understanding of topographic map development in the mammalian visual system and highlights recent advances in map alignment studies.

@article{Caputo1998,
abstract = {Selective attention was studied in displays containing singletons popping out for their odd form or color. The target was defined as the form-singleton, the distractor as the color-singleton. The task was to discriminate the length of a longer line inside the target. Target-distractor similarity was controlled using a threshold measurement as dependent variable in experiments in which distractor presence vs absence, bottom-up vs top-down selection (through knowledge of target features), and target-distractor distance were manipulated. The results in the bottom-up condition showed that length threshold was elevated when a distractor was present and that this elevation progressively increased as the number of distractors was increased from one to two. This set-size effect was not accounted by the hypothesis that selective attention intervenes only at the stage of decision before response. Selective attention produced a suppressive surround in which discriminability of neighboring objects was strongly reduced, and a larger surround in which discriminability was reduced by an approximately constant amount. Different results were found in the top-down condition in which target discriminability was unaffected by distractor presence and no effect of target-distractor distance was found. On the other hand, response times in both bottom-up and top-down conditions were slower the shorter the target-distractor distance was. On the basis of the experimental results, selective attention is a parallel process of spatial filtering at an intermediate processing level operating after objects have been segmented. This filtering stage explores high level interactions between objects taking control on combinatorial explosion by operating over only a limited spatial extent: it picks out a selected object and inhibits the neighboring objects; then, non-selected objects are suppressed across the overall image. When no feature-based selection is available in the current behavior, this filtering influences perception in decreasing discriminability of non-selected objects. When feature-based selection is available, spatial interactions are set before stimulus arrival, hence only the unmatching objects have their discriminability diminished.},

abstract = {There is increasing evidence that the brain relies on a set of canonical neural computations, repeating them across brain regions and modalities to apply similar operations to different problems. A promising candidate for such a computation is normalization, in which the responses of neurons are divided by a common factor that typically includes the summed activity of a pool of neurons. Normalization was developed to explain responses in the primary visual cortex and is now thought to operate throughout the visual system, and in many other sensory modalities and brain regions. Normalization may underlie operations such as the representation of odours, the modulatory effects of visual attention, the encoding of value and the integration of multisensory information. Its presence in such a diversity of neural systems in multiple species, from invertebrates to mammals, suggests that it serves as a canonical neural computation.},

abstract = {The responses of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) are suppressed by mask stimuli that do not elicit responses if presented alone. This suppression is widely believed to be mediated by intracortical inhibition. As an alternative, we propose that it can be explained by thalamocortical synaptic depression. This explanation correctly predicts that suppression is monocular, immune to cortical adaptation, and occurs for mask stimuli that elicit responses in the thalamus but not in the cortex. Depression also explains other phenomena previously ascribed to intracortical inhibition. It explains why responses saturate at high stimulus contrast, whereas selectivity for orientation and spatial frequency is invariant with contrast. It explains why transient responses to flashed stimuli are nonlinear, whereas spatial summation is primarily linear. These results suggest that the very first synapses into the cortex, and not the cortical network, may account for important response properties of V1 neurons.},

Using a generalized version of a well-known computational model of visual cortical map development, we show that the number of excitatory and inhibitory oscillations in this interaction function critically influences map structure. Specifically, we demonstrate that functions that oscillate more than once do not produce maps closely resembling those seen biologically. This strongly suggests that local lateral connections in visual cortex oscillate only once and have the form of a Mexican hat.},

The spatial and temporal determinants of this collinear facilitation have been studied extensively (J. R. Cass \& B. Spehar, 2005; Y. Tanaka \& D. Sagi, 1998; C. B. Williams \& R. F. Hess, 1998), although considerable debate surrounds the neural mechanisms underlying it. Our study examines this question using a novel stimulus, whereby the flanking "contour" elements are rotated around their own axis. By measuring contrast detection thresholds to a brief foveal target presented at various phases of flanker rotation, we find peak facilitation after flankers have rotated beyond their collinear phase. This optimal facilitative delay increases monotonically as a function of target-flanker separation, yielding estimates of cortical propagation of 0.1 m/s, a value highly consistent with the dynamics of long-range horizontal interactions observed within primary visual cortex (V1). A curious new finding is also observed: Facilitative peaks also occur when the target flash precedes flanker collinearity by 20-80 ms, a range consistent with contrast-dependent cortical onset latencies. Together, these data suggest that collinear facilitation involves two separate mechanisms, each possessing distinct dynamics: (i) slowly propagating horizontal interactions within V1 and (ii) a faster integrative mechanism, possibly driven by synchronous collinear cortical onset.},

abstract = {The responsiveness of neurons in V1 is modulated by stimuli placed outside their classical receptive fields. This nonclassical surround provides input from a larger portion of the visual scene than originally thought, permitting integration of information at early levels in the visual processing stream. Signals from the surround have been reported variously to be suppressive and facilitatory, selective and unselective. We tested the specificity of influences from the surround by studying the interactions between drifting sinusoidal gratings carefully confined to conservatively defined center and surround regions. We found that the surround influence was always suppressive when the surround grating was at the neuron's preferred orientation. Suppression tended to be stronger when the surround grating also moved in the neuron's preferred direction, rather than its opposite. When the orientation in the surround was 90 degrees from the preferred orientation (orthogonal), suppression was weaker, and facilitation was sometimes evident. The tuning of surround signals therefore tended to match the tuning of the center, though the tuning of the surround was somewhat broader. The tuning of suppression also depended on the contrast of the center grating-when the center grating was reduced in contrast, orthogonal surround stimuli became relatively more suppressive. We also found evidence for the tuning of the surround being dependent to some degree on the stimulus used in the center-suppression was often stronger for a given center stimulus when the parameters of the surround grating matched the parameters of the center grating even when the center grating was not itself of the optimal direction or orientation. We also explored the spatial distribution of surround influence and found an orderly relationship between the orientation of grating patches presented to regions of the surround and the position of greatest suppression. When surround gratings were oriented parallel to the preferred orientation of the receptive field, suppression was strongest at the receptive field ends. When surround gratings were orthogonal, suppression was strongest on the flanks. We conclude that the surround has complex effects on responses from the classical receptive field. We suggest that the underlying mechanism of this complexity may involve interactions between relatively simple center and surround mechanisms.},

abstract = {Information is integrated across the visual field to transform local features into a global percept. We now know that V1 neurons provide more spatial integration than originally thought due to the existence of their nonclassical inhibitory surrounds. To understand spatial integration in the visual cortex, we have studied the nature and extent of center and surround influences on neuronal response. We used drifting sinusoidal gratings in circular and annular apertures to estimate the sizes of the receptive field's excitatory center and suppressive surround. We used combinations of stimuli inside and outside the receptive field to explore the nature of the surround influence on the receptive field center as a function of the relative and absolute contrast of stimuli in the two regions. We conclude that the interaction is best explained as a divisive modulation of response gain by signals from the surround. We then develop a receptive field model based on the ratio of signals from Gaussian-shaped center and surround mechanisms. We show that this model can account well for the variations in receptive field size with contrast that we and others have observed and for variations in size with the state of contrast adaptation. The model achieves this success by simple variations in the relative gain of the two component mechanisms of the receptive field. This model thus offers a parsimonious explanation of a variety of phenomena involving changes in apparent receptive field size and accounts for these phenomena purely in terms of two receptive field mechanisms that do not themselves change in size. We used the extent of the center mechanism in our model as an indicator of the spatial extent of the central excitatory portion of the receptive field. We compared the extent of the center to measurements of horizontal connections within V1 and determined that horizontal intracortical connections are well matched in extent to the receptive field center mechanism. Input to the suppressive surround may come in part from feedback signals from higher areas.},

abstract = {Rhythmic activity of neuronal ensembles has been proposed to play an important role in cognitive functions such as attention, perception, and memory. Here we investigate whether rhythmic activity in V1 of the macaque monkey (macaca mulatta) is affected by top-down visual attention. We measured the local field potential (LFP) and V1 spiking activity while monkeys performed an attention-demanding detection task. We show that gamma oscillations were strongly modulated by the stimulus and by attention. Stimuli that engaged inhibitory mechanisms induced the largest gamma LFP oscillations and the largest spike field coherence. Directing attention toward a visual stimulus at the receptive field of the recorded neurons decreased LFP gamma power and gamma spike field coherence. This decrease could reflect an attention-mediated reduction of surround inhibition. Changes in synchrony in V1 would thus be a byproduct of reduced inhibitory drive, rather than a mechanism that directly aids perceptual processing.},

abstract = {Neural circuits are composed of mainly glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, which communicate through synaptic connections. Many factors instruct the formation and function of these synapses; however, it is difficult to dissect the contribution of intrinsic cell programs from that of extrinsic environmental effects in an intact network. Here, we perform paired recordings from two-neuron microculture preparations of mouse hippocampal glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons to investigate how synaptic input and output of these two principal cells develop. In our reduced preparation, we found that glutamatergic neurons showed no change in synaptic output or input regardless of partner neuron cell type or neuronal activity level. In contrast, we found that glutamatergic input caused the GABAergic neuron to modify its output by way of an increase in synapse formation and a decrease in synaptic release efficiency. These findings are consistent with aspects of GABAergic synapse maturation observed in many brain regions. In addition, changes in GABAergic output are cell wide and not target-cell specific. We also found that glutamatergic neuronal activity determined the AMPA receptor properties of synapses on the partner GABAergic neuron. All modifications of GABAergic input and output required activity of the glutamatergic neuron. Because our system has reduced extrinsic factors, the changes we saw in the GABAergic neuron due to glutamatergic input may reflect initiation of maturation programs that underlie the formation and function of in vivo neural circuits.},

abstract = {Homeostatic synaptic scaling alters the strength of synapses to compensate for prolonged changes in network activity and involves both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The immediate-early gene Narp (neuronal activity-regulated pentraxin) encodes a secreted synaptic protein that can bind to and induce clustering of AMPA receptors (AMPARs). We found that Narp prominently accumulated at excitatory synapses on parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV-INs). Increasing network activity resulted in a homeostatic increase of excitatory synaptic strength onto PV-INs that increased inhibitory drive and this response was absent in neurons cultured from Narp-/- mice. Activity-dependent changes in the strength of excitatory inputs on PV-INs in acute hippocampal slices were also dependent on Narp and Narp-/- mice had increased sensitivity to kindling-induced seizures. We propose that Narp recruits AMPARs at excitatory synapses onto PV-INs to rebalance network excitation/inhibition dynamics following episodes of increased circuit activity.},

abstract = {The development of orientation preference maps was studied in ferret primary visual cortex using chronic optical imaging of intrinsic signals. The emergence and maturation of the maps were examined over time in single animals. The earliest age at which cortical domains selectively responsive to particular stimulus orientations were observed varied considerably between individuals, from postnatal day 31 to 36. In all cases, the earliest maps seen were low-contrast, with regions of orientation-specific activity that were difficult to distinguish from noise. These early maps matured over a period of several days into the high-contrast, patchy maps typical of adult animals. The structure of the orientation maps was remarkably constant over time. The indistinct features in the earliest maps were always patches of the same sizes and shapes and at the same locations as in the maps obtained in subsequent recording sessions. Details of the more mature maps, including the relative intensities of individual iso-orientation domains, were also constant from one recording session to another over periods of several weeks. The patterning of iso-orientation domains in ferret primary visual cortex thus is established early in development and remains stable over time, unaffected by either normal visual experience or the anatomical rearrangements of geniculocortical afferents into eye-specific domains.},

abstract = {Neurons in the primary visual cortex receive subliminal information originating from the periphery of their receptive fields (RF) through a variety of cortical connections. In the cat primary visual cortex, long-range horizontal axons have been reported to preferentially bind to distant columns of similar orientation preferences, whereas feedback connections from higher visual areas provide a more diverse functional input. To understand the role of these lateral interactions, it is crucial to characterize their effective functional connectivity and tuning properties. However, the overall functional impact of cortical lateral connections, whatever their anatomical origin, is unknown since it has never been directly characterized. Using direct measurements of postsynaptic integration in cat areas 17 and 18, we performed multi-scale assessments of the functional impact of visually driven lateral networks. Voltage-sensitive dye imaging showed that local oriented stimuli evoke an orientation-selective activity that remains confined to the cortical feedforward imprint of the stimulus. Beyond a distance of one hypercolumn, the lateral spread of cortical activity gradually lost its orientation preference approximated as an exponential with a space constant of about 1 mm. Intracellular recordings showed that this loss of orientation selectivity arises from the diversity of converging synaptic input patterns originating from outside the classical RF. In contrast, when the stimulus size was increased, we observed orientation-selective spread of activation beyond the feedforward imprint. We conclude that stimulus-induced cooperativity enhances the long-range orientation-selective spread.},

abstract = {Many animals rely on visual motion detection for survival. Motion information is extracted from spatiotemporal intensity patterns on the retina, a paradigmatic neural computation. A phenomenological model, the Hassenstein-Reichardt correlator (HRC), relates visual inputs to neural activity and behavioral responses to motion, but the circuits that implement this computation remain unknown. By using cell-type specific genetic silencing, minimal motion stimuli, and in vivo calcium imaging, we examine two critical HRC inputs. These two pathways respond preferentially to light and dark moving edges. We demonstrate that these pathways perform overlapping but complementary subsets of the computations underlying the HRC. A numerical model implementing differential weighting of these operations displays the observed edge preferences. Intriguingly, these pathways are distinguished by their sensitivities to a stimulus correlation that corresponds to an illusory percept, "reverse phi," that affects many species. Thus, this computational architecture may be widely used to achieve edge selectivity in motion detection.},

abstract = {Spatial context in images induces perceptual phenomena associated with salience and modulates the responses of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1). However, the computational and ecological principles underlying contextual effects are incompletely understood. We introduce a model of natural images that includes grouping and segmentation of neighboring features based on their joint statistics, and we interpret the firing rates of V1 neurons as performing optimal recognition in this model. We show that this leads to a substantial generalization of divisive normalization, a computation that is ubiquitous in many neural areas and systems. A main novelty in our model is that the influence of the context on a target stimulus is determined by their degree of statistical dependence. We optimized the parameters of the model on natural image patches, and then simulated neural and perceptual responses on stimuli used in classical experiments. The model reproduces some rich and complex response patterns observed in V1, such as the contrast dependence, orientation tuning and spatial asymmetry of surround suppression, while also allowing for surround facilitation under conditions of weak stimulation. It also mimics the perceptual salience produced by simple displays, and leads to readily testable predictions. Our results provide a principled account of orientation-based contextual modulation in early vision and its sensitivity to the homogeneity and spatial arrangement of inputs, and lends statistical support to the theory that V1 computes visual salience.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional maps of individual layers of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in the macaque monkey were constructed and used as a basis for comparing laminar size, shape, and topographic organization. Topographical data from the electrophysiological investigation of the LGN by Malpeli and Baker ('75) were displayed on maps of all six layers. As known from previous studies, there is a significant over-representation of central vision in the LGN. Unexpectedly, though, the visual representation is anisotropic over portions of most LGN layers. That is, the linear magnification factor (millimeters along the laminar surface per degree of visual field) is not equal for all directions from a given point in the visual field. Moreover, the visual representations in the parvicellular and magnocellular divisions of the LGN differ both in their emphasis on central vision and in their anisotropies. To determine the degree of individual variability, laminar maps were prepared from the LGN of seven other hemispheres. The shapes of laminar maps varied considerably between LGNs, from nearly circular to highly elliptical, but the surface area was relatively constant for each layer. Topographical organization, determined by mapping the optic disc representation on the LGN laminae and by labeling from anterograde and retrograde tracer injections in striate cortex, showed significant individual variability. Interestingly, the visual representations in the LGN and striate cortex are topologically inverted with respect to one another. This indicates that the establishment of geniculocortical connections involves a systematic crossing-over of fibers. Information on cell densities and magnification factors in striate cortex obtained from other studies was compared to the results of the present study in order to estimate ratios of cortical neurons to LGN neurons at different eccentricities. The total number of cortical neurons per LGN neuron is about 130 on average, but it extends over approximately a tenfold range, from less than 100 in the far periphery to nearly 1,000 in the fovea. The estimated number of cells in layers 4A and 4C beta per parvicellular layer neuron is smaller and extends over a slightly narrower range, from 30 to 240, whereas the number of layer 4C alpha neurons per magnocellular neuron varies more widely, from about 45 to 7,000.},

abstract = {The thalamus provides fundamental input to the neocortex. This input activates inhibitory interneurons more strongly than excitatory neurons, triggering powerful feedforward inhibition. We studied the mechanisms of this selective neuronal activation using a mouse somatosensory thalamocortical preparation. Notably, the greater responsiveness of inhibitory interneurons was not caused by their distinctive intrinsic properties but was instead produced by synaptic mechanisms. Axons from the thalamus made stronger and more frequent excitatory connections onto inhibitory interneurons than onto excitatory cells. Furthermore, circuit dynamics allowed feedforward inhibition to suppress responses in excitatory cells more effectively than in interneurons. Thalamocortical excitatory currents rose quickly in interneurons, allowing them to fire action potentials before significant feedforward inhibition emerged. In contrast, thalamocortical excitatory currents rose slowly in excitatory cells, overlapping with feedforward inhibitory currents that suppress action potentials. These results demonstrate the importance of selective synaptic targeting and precise timing in the initial stages of neocortical processing.},

One of its key predictions is that to simultaneously solve the problems of convergence of neural input and selection of attended items, the portions of the visual neural network that process an attended stimulus must be surrounded by inhibition. To test this hypothesis, we mapped the attentional field around an attended location in a matching task where the subject's attention was directed to a cued target while the distance of a probe item to the target was varied systematically. The main result was that accuracy increased with inter-target separation. The observed pattern of variation of accuracy with distance provided strong evidence in favor of the critical prediction of the model that attention is actively inhibited in the immediate vicinity of an attended location.},

abstract = {Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) respond differently to a simple visual element presented in isolation from when it is embedded within a complex image. This difference, a specific modulation by surrounding elements in the image, is mediated by short- and long-range connections within V1 and by feedback from other areas. Here we study the role of short-range connections in this process, and relate it to the layout of local inhomogeneities in the cortical maps of orientation and space. By measuring correlation between neuron pairs located in optically imaged maps of V1 orientation columns we show that the strength of local connections between cells is a graded function of lateral separation across cortex, largely radially symmetrical and relatively independent of orientation preferences. We then show the contextual influence of flanking visual elements on neuronal responses varies systematically with a neuron's position within the cortical orientation map. The strength of this contextual influence on a neuron can be predicted from a model of local connections based on simple overlap with particular features of the orientation map. This indicates that local intracortical circuitry could endow neurons with a graded specialization for processing angular visual features such as corners and T junctions, and this specialization could have its own functional cortical map, linked with the orientation map.},

abstract = {Studies of the primary visual cortex (V1) have produced models that account for neuronal responses to synthetic stimuli such as sinusoidal gratings. Little is known about how these models generalize to activity during natural vision. We recorded neural responses in area V1 of awake macaques to a stimulus with natural spatiotemporal statistics and to a dynamic grating sequence stimulus. We fit nonlinear receptive field models using each of these data sets and compared how well they predicted time-varying responses to a novel natural visual stimulus. On average, the model fit using the natural stimulus predicted natural visual responses more than twice as accurately as the model fit to the synthetic stimulus. The natural vision model produced better predictions in >75\% of the neurons studied. This large difference in predictive power suggests that natural spatiotemporal stimulus statistics activate nonlinear response properties in a different manner than the grating stimulus. To characterize this modulation, we compared the temporal and spatial response properties of the model fits. During natural stimulation, temporal responses often showed a stronger late inhibitory component, indicating an effect of nonlinear temporal summation during natural vision. In addition, spatial tuning underwent complex shifts, primarily in the inhibitory, rather than excitatory, elements of the response profile. These differences in late and spatially tuned inhibition accounted fully for the difference in predictive power between the two models. Both the spatial and temporal statistics of the natural stimulus contributed to the modulatory effects.},

abstract = {Attention increases our ability to detect behaviorally relevant stimuli. At the neuronal level this is supported by increased firing rates of neurons representing the attended object. In primary visual cortex an attention-mediated activity increase depends on the presence of the neuromodulator acetylcholine. Using a spiking network model of visual cortex we have investigated how acetylcholine interacts with biased feedback to enable attentional processing. Although acetylcholine affects cortical processing in a multitude of manners, we restricted our analysis to four of its main established actions. These were (i) a reduction in firing rate adaptation by reduction in M-currents (muscarinic), (ii) an increase in thalamocortical synaptic efficacy by nicotinic presynaptic receptors, (iii) a reduction in lateral interactions by muscarinic presynaptic receptors, and (iv) an increase in inhibitory drive by muscarinic receptors located on inhibitory interneurons. We found that acetylcholine contributes to feedback-mediated attentional modulation, mostly by reducing intracortical interactions and also to some extent by increasing the inhibitory drive. These findings help explain why acetylcholine is necessary for top-down-driven attentional modulation, and suggest a close interdependence of cholinergic and feedback drive in mediating cognitive function.},

abstract = {Attention is a rich psychological and neurobiological construct that influences almost all aspects of cognitive behaviour. It enables enhanced processing of behaviourally relevant stimuli at the expense of irrelevant stimuli. At the cellular level, rhythmic synchronization at local and long-range spatial scales complements the attention-induced firing rate changes of neurons. The former is hypothesized to enable efficient communication between neuronal ensembles tuned to spatial and featural aspects of the attended stimulus. Recent modelling studies suggest that the rhythmic synchronization in the gamma range may be mediated by a fine balance between N-methyl-D-aspartate and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate postsynaptic currents, whereas other studies have highlighted the possible contribution of the neuromodulator acetylcholine. This review summarizes some recent modelling and experimental studies investigating mechanisms of attention in sensory areas and discusses possibilities of how glutamatergic and cholinergic systems could contribute to increased processing abilities at the cellular and network level during states of top-down attention.},

abstract = {Immunocytochemical techniques were used to examine the distribution of double-bouquet cells and chandelier cells that were immunoreactive (-ir) for the calcium-binding proteins calbindin (CB), calretinin (CR), and parvalbumin (PV) in the primary visual area (V1), the second visual area (V2), and cytoarchitectonic area TE in the macaque monkey. Furthermore, the connections between CB-, CR-, and PV-ir neurons in these visual areas were investigated at the light microscope level by using a dual-immunocytochemical staining procedure. The most significant findings were three-fold. First, the number and distribution of CB-ir and CR-ir double-bouquet cells and PV-ir chandelier cells differed considerably between different visual areas. In particular, the different distribution of double-bouquet cells was illustrated dramatically at the V1/V2 border, where CB-ir double-bouquet axons were very few or lacking in V1 but were very numerous in V2. Furthermore, PV-ir chandelier cell terminals were relatively sparse in V1, more frequent in V2, and most frequent in area TE. Second, the percentage of CB-, CR-, and PV-ir neurons receiving multiple contacts on their somata and proximal dendrites from other calcium-binding protein neurons varied between 22\% and 85\%. The highest percentage of contacts found between immunolabelled cells and multiterminals were for the combinations CR/CB (76-85\%; percent of cells immunoreactive for CB that were innervated by multiterminals immunoreactive for CR), followed by the combination PV/CR (42-48\%), and then by the other combinations that had similar percentages (22-32\% for CR/PV; 26-37\% for CB/CR; 29-42\% for CR/PV). Third, differences in the relative proportions of CB, CR, and PV terminals in contact with CB-, CR-, and PV-ir neurons were consistent between the different cortical areas studied. Thus, certain characteristics of intraareal circuits differ, whereas others remain similar, in different areas of the occipitotemporal visual pathway. The differences may represent regional specializations related to the different processing of visual stimuli, whereas the similarities may be attributed to general functional requisites for interneuronal circuitry.},

abstract = {The discharges of single neurones in the parvocellular and magnocellular laminae of the macaque's lateral geniculate nucleus (l.g.n.) were recorded with glass-insulated tungsten micro-electrodes. Linearity of spatial summation was examined using the test devised by Hochstein \& Shapley (1976). 2 of 272 parvocellular units and 6 of 105 magnocellular units showed clearly non-linear spatial summation. A quantitative index of non-linearity did not suggest the existence of a distinct 'non-linear' class of magnocellular unit. Spatial contrast sensitivity to moving gratings was measured by a tracking procedure in which contrast was adjusted to elicit a reliable modulation of discharge. With the exception of cells that were driven by blue-sensitive cones, measurements of contrast sensitivity did not reveal distinct subgroups of parvocellular units. All had low sensitivity, and those with receptive fields in the fovea could resolve spatial frequencies of up to 40 cycles deg-1. Magnocellular units had substantially higher sensitivity, but poorer spatial resolution. The higher sensitivities of magnocellular units led to their giving saturated responses to stimuli of high contrast. Responses of parvocellular units were rarely saturated by any stimulus. At any one eccentricity the receptive fields of parvocellular units had smaller centres than did those of magnocellular units. Receptive fields of magnocellular units driven by the ipsilateral eye had larger receptive fields than did those driven by the contralateral eye. Parvocellular units were most sensitive to stimuli modulated at temporal frequencies close to 10 Hz; magnocellular units to stimuli modulated at frequencies nearer 20 Hz. The loss of sensitivity as temporal frequency fell below optimum was more marked in magnocellular than parvocellular units. Changes in temporal frequency altered the shapes of the spatial contrast sensitivity curves of both parvocellular and magnocellular units. These changes could be explained by supposing that centre and surround have different temporal properties, and that the surround is relatively less sensitive to higher temporal frequencies.},

Here we show that the distributions of two major classes of GABAergic synapses along the perisomatic and dendritic domains of pyramidal neurons were indistinguishable between primary visual cortex in vivo and cortical organotypic cultures. Therefore, subcellular synapse targeting is independent of thalamic input and probably involves molecular labels and experience-independent forms of activity.},

abstract = {Acetylcholine (ACh) has been implicated in selective attention. To understand the local circuit action of ACh, we iontophoresed cholinergic agonists into the primate primary visual cortex (V1) while presenting optimal visual stimuli. Consistent with our previous anatomical studies showing that GABAergic neurons in V1 express ACh receptors to a greater extent than do excitatory neurons, we observed suppressed visual responses in 36\% of recorded neurons outside V1's primary thalamorecipient layer (4c). This suppression is blocked by the GABA(A) receptor antagonist gabazine. Within layer 4c, ACh release produces a response gain enhancement (Disney AA, Aoki C, Hawken MJ. Neuron 56: 701-713, 2007); elsewhere, ACh suppresses response gain by strengthening inhibition. Our finding contrasts with the observation that the dominant mechanism of suppression in the neocortex of rats is reduced glutamate release. We propose that in primates, distinct cholinergic receptor subtypes are recruited on specific cell types and in specific lamina to yield opposing modulatory effects that together increase neurons' responsiveness to optimal stimuli without changing tuning width.},

abstract = {Acetylcholine is a ubiquitous cortical neuromodulator implicated in cognition. In order to understand the potential for acetylcholine to play a role in visual attention, we studied nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) localization and function in area V1 of the macaque. We found nAChRs presynaptically at thalamic synapses onto excitatory, but not inhibitory, neurons in the primary thalamorecipient layer 4c. Furthermore, consistent with the release enhancement suggested by this localization, we discovered that nicotine increases responsiveness and lowers contrast threshold in layer 4c neurons. We also found that nAChRs are expressed by GABAergic interneurons in V1 but rarely by pyramidal neurons, and that nicotine suppresses visual responses outside layer 4c. All sensory systems incorporate gain control mechanisms, or processes which dynamically alter input/output relationships. We demonstrate that at the site of thalamic input to visual cortex, the effect of this nAChR-mediated gain is an enhancement of the detection of visual stimuli.},

abstract = {Improvements in performance on visual tasks due to practice are often specific to a retinal position or stimulus feature. Many researchers suggest that specific perceptual learning alters selective retinotopic representations in early visual analysis. However, transfer is almost always practically advantageous, and it does occur. If perceptual learning alters location-specific representations, how does it transfer to new locations? An integrated reweighting theory explains transfer over retinal locations by incorporating higher level location-independent representations into a multilevel learning system. Location transfer is mediated through location-independent representations, whereas stimulus feature transfer is determined by stimulus similarity at both location-specific and location-independent levels. Transfer to new locations/positions differs fundamentally from transfer to new stimuli. After substantial initial training on an orientation discrimination task, switches to a new location or position are compared with switches to new orientations in the same position, or switches of both. Position switches led to the highest degree of transfer, whereas orientation switches led to the highest levels of specificity. A computational model of integrated reweighting is developed and tested that incorporates the details of the stimuli and the experiment. Transfer to an identical orientation task in a new position is mediated via more broadly tuned location-invariant representations, whereas changing orientation in the same position invokes interference or independent learning of the new orientations at both levels, reflecting stimulus dissimilarity. Consistent with single-cell recording studies, perceptual learning alters the weighting of both early and midlevel representations of the visual system.},

This report describes how populations of neurons in cat visual cortex can use excitatory feedback, characterized as an effective "network conductance", to amplify their feedforward input signals and demonstrates how neuronal discharge can be kept proportional to stimulus strength despite strong, recurrent connections that threaten to cause runaway excitation. These principles are incorporated into models of cortical direction and orientation selectivity that emphasize the basic design principles of cortical architectures.},

It is currently unclear how individual, localized parts are able to coordinate with each other to develop a whole organ shape. Here we report the dynamic, autonomous formation of the optic cup (retinal primordium) structure from a three-dimensional culture of mouse embryonic stem cell aggregates. Embryonic-stem-cell-derived retinal epithelium spontaneously formed hemispherical epithelial vesicles that became patterned along their proximal-distal axis. Whereas the proximal portion differentiated into mechanically rigid pigment epithelium, the flexible distal portion progressively folded inward to form a shape reminiscent of the embryonic optic cup, exhibited interkinetic nuclear migration and generated stratified neural retinal tissue, as seen in vivo. We demonstrate that optic-cup morphogenesis in this simple cell culture depends on an intrinsic self-organizing program involving stepwise and domain-specific regulation of local epithelial properties.},

Their findings revealed an early innate period of development and a later critical period of dramatic experience-dependent plasticity. Recent studies have used rodents to benefit from biochemistry and genetics. The roles of spontaneous neural activity and molecular signaling in innate, experience-independent development have been clarified, as have the later roles of visual experience. Plasticity produced by monocular visual deprivation (MD) has been dissected into stages governed by distinct signaling mechanisms, some of whose molecular players are known. Many crucial questions remain, but new tools for perturbing cortical cells and measuring plasticity at the level of changes in connections among identified neurons now exist. The future for the study of V1 to illuminate cortical development and plasticity is bright.},

Experience-dependent refinements are often restricted to well-defined critical periods in early life, but how these are established remains mostly unknown. A representative example is the loss of responsiveness in neocortex to an eye deprived of vision. Here we show that the potential for plasticity is retained throughout life until an inhibitory threshold is attained. In mice of all ages lacking an isoform of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) synthetic enzyme (GAD65), as well as in immature wild-type animals before the onset of their natural critical period, benzodiazepines selectively reduced a prolonged discharge phenotype to unmask plasticity. Enhancing GABA-mediated transmission early in life rendered mutant animals insensitive to monocular deprivation as adults, similar to normal wild-type mice. Short-term presynaptic dynamics reflected a synaptic reorganization in GAD65 knockout mice after chronic diazepam treatment. A threshold level of inhibition within the visual cortex may thus trigger, once in life, an experience-dependent critical period for circuit consolidation, which may otherwise lie dormant.},

abstract = {Macaque visual area V4 has been implicated in the selective processing of stimuli. Prior studies of selection in area V4 have used spatially separate stimuli, thus confounding selection of retinotopic location with selection of the stimulus at that location. We asked whether V4 neurons can selectively respond to one of two differently colored stimuli even when they are spatially superimposed. We find that delaying one of the two stimuli leads to selective processing of the delayed stimulus by area V4 neurons. This selective processing persists when the stimuli move together across the visual field, thereby successively activating different populations of neurons. We also find that this effect is not a spatially global form of feature-based selection. We conclude that selective processing in area V4 is neither exclusively spatial nor feature-based and may thus be surface- or object-based.},

abstract = {Natural images are usually cluttered because objects occlude one another. A critical aspect of recognizing these visual objects is to identify the borders between image regions that belong to different objects. However, the neural coding of border ownership in human visual cortex is largely unknown. In this study, we designed two simple but compelling stimuli in which a slight change of contextual information could induce a dramatic change of border ownership. Using functional MRI adaptation, we found that border ownership selectivity in V2 was robust and reliable across subjects, and it was largely dependent on attention. Our study provides the first human evidence that V2 is a critical area for the processing of border ownership and that this processing depends on the modulation from higher-level cortical areas.},

abstract = {We suggested recently that attention can be understood as inferring the level of uncertainty or precision during hierarchical perception. In this paper, we try to substantiate this claim using neuronal simulations of directed spatial attention and biased competition. These simulations assume that neuronal activity encodes a probabilistic representation of the world that optimizes free-energy in a Bayesian fashion. Because free-energy bounds surprise or the (negative) log-evidence for internal models of the world, this optimization can be regarded as evidence accumulation or (generalized) predictive coding. Crucially, both predictions about the state of the world generating sensory data and the precision of those data have to be optimized. Here, we show that if the precision depends on the states, one can explain many aspects of attention. We illustrate this in the context of the Posner paradigm, using the simulations to generate both psychophysical and electrophysiological responses. These simulated responses are consistent with attentional bias or gating, competition for attentional resources, attentional capture and associated speed-accuracy trade-offs. Furthermore, if we present both attended and non-attended stimuli simultaneously, biased competition for neuronal representation emerges as a principled and straightforward property of Bayes-optimal perception.},

abstract = {A central hypothesis concerning sensory processing is that the neuronal circuits are specifically adapted to represent natural stimuli efficiently. Here we show a novel effect in cortical coding of natural images. Using spike-triggered average or spike-triggered covariance analyses, we first identified the visual features selectively represented by each cortical neuron from its responses to natural images. We then measured the neuronal sensitivity to these features when they were present in either natural images or random stimuli. We found that in the responses of complex cells, but not of simple cells, the sensitivity was markedly higher for natural images than for random stimuli. Such elevated sensitivity leads to increased detectability of the visual features and thus an improved cortical representation of natural scenes. Interestingly, this effect is due not to the spatial power spectra of natural images, but to their phase regularities. These results point to a distinct visual-coding strategy that is mediated by contextual modulation of cortical responses tuned to the spatial-phase structure of natural scenes.},

abstract = {The function of any neural circuit is governed by connectivity of neurons in the circuit and the computations performed by the neurons. Recent research on retinal function has substantially advanced understanding in both areas. First, visual information is transmitted to the brain by at least 17 distinct retinal ganglion cell types defined by characteristic morphology, light response properties, and central projections. These findings provide a much more accurate view of the parallel visual pathways emanating from the retina than do previous models, and they highlight the importance of identifying distinct cell types and their connectivity in other neural circuits. Second, encoding of visual information involves significant temporal structure and interactions in the spike trains of retinal neurons. The functional importance of this structure is revealed by computational analysis of encoding and decoding, an approach that may be applicable to understanding the function of other neural circuits.},

abstract = {To understand a neural circuit requires knowledge of its connectivity. Here we report measurements of functional connectivity between the input and ouput layers of the macaque retina at single-cell resolution and the implications of these for colour vision. Multi-electrode technology was used to record simultaneously from complete populations of the retinal ganglion cell types (midget, parasol and small bistratified) that transmit high-resolution visual signals to the brain. Fine-grained visual stimulation was used to identify the location, type and strength of the functional input of each cone photoreceptor to each ganglion cell. The populations of ON and OFF midget and parasol cells each sampled the complete population of long- and middle-wavelength-sensitive cones. However, only OFF midget cells frequently received strong input from short-wavelength-sensitive cones. ON and OFF midget cells showed a small non-random tendency to selectively sample from either long- or middle-wavelength-sensitive cones to a degree not explained by clumping in the cone mosaic. These measurements reveal computations in a neural circuit at the elementary resolution of individual neurons.},

abstract = {Simple cells in primary visual cortex exhibit contrast-invariant orientation tuning, in seeming contradiction to feed-forward models that rely on lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) input alone. Contrast invariance has therefore been thought to depend on the presence of intracortical lateral inhibition. In vivo intracellular recordings instead suggest that contrast invariance can be explained by three properties of the excitatory pathway. (1) Depolarizations evoked by orthogonal stimuli are determined by the amount of excitation a cell receives from the LGN, relative to the excitation it receives from other cortical cells. (2) Depolarizations evoked by preferred stimuli saturate at lower contrasts than the spike output of LGN relay cells. (3) Visual stimuli evoke contrast-dependent changes in trial-to-trial variability, which lead to contrast-dependent changes in the relationship between membrane potential and spike rate. Thus, high-contrast, orthogonally oriented stimuli that evoke significant depolarizations evoke few spikes. Together these mechanisms, without lateral inhibition, can account for contrast-invariant stimulus selectivity.},

To test the model, we generated novel forms of visual metamers, stimuli that differ physically but look the same. We developed a behavioral protocol that uses metameric stimuli to estimate the receptive field sizes in which the model features are represented. Because receptive field sizes change along the ventral stream, our behavioral results can identify the visual area corresponding to the representation. Measurements in human observers implicate visual area V2, providing a new functional account of neurons in this area. The model also explains deficits of peripheral vision known as crowding, and provides a quantitative framework for assessing the capabilities and limitations of everyday vision.},

Evidence for this inhibition is commonly found in cross-orientation suppression: responses of a V1 neuron to optimally oriented bars are suppressed by superimposed mask bars of different orientation. We show, however, that suppression is unlikely to result from intracortical inhibition. First, suppression can be obtained with masks drifting too rapidly to elicit much of a response in cortex. Second, suppression is immune to hyperpolarization (through visual adaptation) of cortical neurons responding to the mask. Signals mediating suppression might originate in thalamus, rather than in cortex. Thalamic neurons exhibit some suppression; additional suppression might arise from depression at thalamocortical synapses. The mechanisms of suppression are subcortical and possibly include the very first synapse into cortex.},

abstract = {The aim of the Royaumont Symposium was to review various dynamic aspects of adaptive changes in functional connectivity, expressed in cortical networks during development, learning, and possibly during recognition and cognitive processing. The link between the various experimental and theoretical models was the comparison of cellular and molecular mechanisms that could be involved in the up- and down-regulation of functional connectivity, over different time scales. These processes have been investigated using several approaches in parallel: 1) at the molecular/subcellular level, to identify postsynaptic receptors (NMDA, mGluR) and second messengers (calcium protein kinases and phosphatases) involved in the induction of synaptic potentiation and depression, and to characterize diffusible factors (NO), released pre- or postsynaptically, involved in the spatial generalization of local changes to neighboring synapses; 2) at the level of integrating networks, to develop electrophysiological (single and multiple recording), pharmacological and optical imaging techniques in order to compare the dynamics of adaptive processes put into play during the natural development of cortical specificity and connectivity, versus those triggered during forced regimes of temporal correlations between pre- and post synaptic activities. Both in vitro and in vivo approaches have been combined in the primary visual cortex of the developing and adult vertebrate (rat, guinea-pig, ferret, cat and monkey). The various forms of 'slow' synaptic plasticity, demonstrated during epigenesis and selective phases of learning in the adult, can be compared with 'fast' forms of functional coupling (or synchronous firing) shown to develop during the time span required for perception and cognitive processing Phenomenology of the dynamics in functional connectivity and their relative dependence on temporal correlation in neuronal activity have been analyzed in each of these situations. Experimental results have been compared at different levels of neuronal integration (synapse, column map and cell assembly) in order to gain a better understanding of functional grouping within cortical networks.},

Representations of individual identity should thus exist that are invariant to accidental image transformations like view direction. We targeted the recently discovered face-processing network of the macaque monkey that consists of six interconnected face-selective regions and recorded from the two middle patches (ML, middle lateral, and MF, middle fundus) and two anterior patches (AL, anterior lateral, and AM, anterior medial). We found that the anatomical position of a face patch was associated with a unique functional identity: Face patches differed qualitatively in how they represented identity across head orientations. Neurons in ML and MF were view-specific; neurons in AL were tuned to identity mirror-symmetrically across views, thus achieving partial view invariance; and neurons in AM, the most anterior face patch, achieved almost full view invariance.},

Pathology extends this conclusion further, as the former is implicated in epilepsy and the latter in anxiety.

abstract = {The brain's response to sensory input is strikingly modulated by behavioral state. Notably, the visual response of mouse primary visual cortex (V1) is enhanced by locomotion, a tractable and accessible example of a time-locked change in cortical state. The neural circuits that transmit behavioral state to sensory cortex to produce this modulation are unknown. In vivo calcium imaging of behaving animals revealed that locomotion activates vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-positive neurons in mouse V1 independent of visual stimulation and largely through nicotinic inputs from basal forebrain. Optogenetic activation of VIP neurons increased V1 visual responses in stationary awake mice, artificially mimicking the effect of locomotion, and photolytic damage of VIP neurons abolished the enhancement of V1 responses by locomotion. These findings establish a cortical circuit for the enhancement of visual response by locomotion and provide a potential common circuit for the modulation of sensory processing by behavioral state. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The cholinergic neurotransmitter system is critically linked to cognitive functions including attention. The current studies were designed to evaluate the effect of a cholinergic agonist and an antagonist on performance during a selective visual attention task where the inherent salience of attended/unattended stimuli was modulated. Two randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover studies were performed, one (n=9) with the anticholinesterase physostigmine (1.0 mg/h), and the other (n=30) with the anticholinergic scopolamine (0.4 mc/kg). During the task, two double-exposure pictures of faces and houses were presented side by side. Subjects were cued to attend to either the face or the house component of the stimuli, and were instructed to perform a matching task with the two exemplars from the attended category. The cue changed every 4-7 trials to instruct subjects to shift attention from one stimulus component to the other. During placebo in both studies, reaction time (RT) associated with the first trial following a cued shift in attention was longer than RT associated with later trials (p<0.05); RT also was significantly longer when attending to houses than to faces (p<0.05). Physostigmine decreased RT relative to placebo preferentially during trials greater than one (p<0.05), with no change during trial one; and decreased RT preferentially during the attention to houses condition (p<0.05) vs attention to faces. Scopolamine increased RT relative to placebo selectively during trials greater than one (p<0.05), and preferentially increased RT during the attention to faces condition (p<0.05). The results suggest that enhancement or impairment of cholinergic activity preferentially influences the maintenance of selective attention (ie trials greater than 1). Moreover, effects of cholinergic manipulation depend on the selective attention condition (ie faces vs houses), which may suggest that cholinergic activity interacts with stimulus salience. The findings are discussed within the context of the role of acetylcholine both in stimulus processing and stimulus salience, and in establishing attention biases through top-down and bottom-up mechanisms of attention.},

abstract = {The temporal features of tactile stimuli are faithfully represented by the activity of neurons in the somatosensory cortex. However, the cellular mechanisms that enable cortical neurons to report accurate temporal information are not known. Here, we show that in the rodent barrel cortex, the temporal window for integration of thalamic inputs is under the control of thalamocortical feed-forward inhibition and can vary from 1 to 10 ms. A single thalamic fiber can trigger feed-forward inhibition and contacts both excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons. The dynamics of feed-forward inhibition exceed those of each individual synapse in the circuit and are captured by a simple disynaptic model of the thalamocortical projection. The variations in the integration window produce changes in the temporal precision of cortical responses to whisker stimulation. Hence, feed-forward inhibitory circuits, classically known to sharpen spatial contrast of tactile inputs, also increase the temporal resolution in the somatosensory cortex.},

abstract = {Neocortical GABAergic neurons have diverse molecular, structural and electrophysiological features, but the functional correlates of this diversity are largely unknown. We found unique membrane potential dynamics of somatostatin-expressing (SOM) neurons in layer 2/3 of the primary somatosensory barrel cortex of awake behaving mice. SOM neurons were spontaneously active during periods of quiet wakefulness. However, SOM neurons hyperpolarized and reduced action potential firing in response to both passive and active whisker sensing, in contrast with all other recorded types of nearby neurons, which were excited by sensory input. Optogenetic inhibition of SOM neurons increased burst firing in nearby excitatory neurons. We hypothesize that the spontaneous activity of SOM neurons during quiet wakefulness provides a tonic inhibition to the distal dendrites of excitatory pyramidal neurons. Conversely, the inhibition of SOM cells during active cortical processing likely enhances distal dendritic excitability, which may be important for top-down computations and sensorimotor integration.},

abstract = {Performance in visual discrimination tasks improves with practice. Although the psychophysical parameters of these improvements have suggested the involvement of early areas in visual cortex, there has been little direct study of the physiological correlates of such perceptual learning at the level of individual neurons. To examine how neuronal response properties in the early visual system may change with practice, we trained monkeys for more than 6 mo in an orientation discrimination task in which behaviorally relevant stimuli were restricted to a particular retinal location and oriented around a specific orientation. During training the monkeys' discrimination thresholds gradually improved to much better than those of naive monkeys or humans. Although this improvement was specific to the trained orientation, it showed little retinotopic specificity. The receptive field properties of single neurons from regions representing the trained location and a location in the opposite visual hemifield were measured in V1 and V2. In most respects the receptive field properties in the representations of the trained and untrained regions were indistinguishable. However, in the regions of V1 and V2 representing the trained location, there were slightly fewer neurons whose optimal orientation was near the trained orientation. This resulted in a small but significant decrease in the V1 population response to the trained orientation at the trained location. Consequently, the observed neuronal populations did not exhibit any orientation-specific biases sufficient to explain the orientation specificity of the behavioral improvement. Pooling models suggest that the behavioral improvement was accomplished with a task-dependent and orientation-selective pooling of unaltered signals from early visual neurons. These data suggest that, even for training with stimuli suited to the selectivities found in early areas of visual cortex, behavioral improvements can occur in the absence of pronounced changes in the physiology of those areas.},

We tested the specificity of regulation in two excitatory pathways of the neocortex: thalamocortical (TC) synapses, which mediate specific inputs, and intracortical (IC) synapses, which mediate the recombination of cortical information. Frequency-sensitive depression was much stronger in TC synapses than in IC synapses. The two synapse types were differentially sensitive to presynaptic neuromodulators: only IC synapses were suppressed by activation of GABA(B) receptors, only TC synapses were enhanced by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors suppressed both synapse types. Modulators also differentially altered the frequency sensitivity of the synapses. Our results suggest a mechanism by which the relative strength and dynamics of input and associational pathways of neocortex are regulated during changes in behavioral state.},

abstract = {There are many influences on our perception of local features. What we see is not strictly a reflection of the physical characteristics of a scene but instead is highly dependent on the processes by which our brain attempts to interpret the scene. As a result, our percepts are shaped by the context within which local features are presented, by our previous visual experiences, operating over a wide range of time scales, and by our expectation of what is before us. The substrate for these influences is likely to be found in the lateral interactions operating within individual areas of the cerebral cortex and in the feedback from higher to lower order cortical areas. Even at early stages in the visual pathway, cells are far more flexible in their functional properties than previously thought. It had long been assumed that cells in primary visual cortex had fixed properties, passing along the product of a stereotyped operation to the next stage in the visual pathway. Any plasticity dependent on visual experience was thought to be restricted to a period early in the life of the animal, the critical period. Furthermore, the assembly of contours and surfaces into unified percepts was assumed to take place at high levels in the visual pathway, whereas the receptive fields of cells in primary visual cortex represented very small windows on the visual scene. These concepts of spatial integration and plasticity have been radically modified in the past few years. The emerging view is that even at the earliest stages in the cortical processing of visual information, cells are highly mutable in their functional properties and are capable of integrating information over a much larger part of visual space than originally believed.},

The contextual influences mediating this process may be derived from long range connections within primary visual cortex (V1). These influences are subject to perceptual learning, and are strongly modulated by visuospatial attention, which is itself a learning dependent process.

abstract = {Humans are good at performing visual tasks, but experimental measurements have revealed substantial biases in the perception of basic visual attributes. An appealing hypothesis is that these biases arise through a process of statistical inference, in which information from noisy measurements is fused with a probabilistic model of the environment. However, such inference is optimal only if the observer's internal model matches the environment. We found this to be the case. We measured performance in an orientation-estimation task and found that orientation judgments were more accurate at cardinal (horizontal and vertical) orientations. Judgments made under conditions of uncertainty were strongly biased toward cardinal orientations. We estimated observers' internal models for orientation and found that they matched the local orientation distribution measured in photographs. In addition, we determined how a neural population could embed probabilistic information responsible for such biases.},

abstract = {Neurons in primary sensory cortex have diverse response properties, whereas higher cortical areas are specialized. Specific connectivity may be important for areal specialization, particularly in the mouse, where neighboring neurons are functionally diverse. To examine whether higher visual areas receive functionally specific input from primary visual cortex (V1), we used two-photon calcium imaging to measure responses of axons from V1 arborizing in three areas with distinct spatial and temporal frequency preferences. We found that visual preferences of presynaptic boutons in each area were distinct and matched the average preferences of recipient neurons. This specificity could not be explained by organization within V1 and instead was due to both a greater density and greater response amplitude of functionally matched boutons. Projections from a single layer (layer 5) and from secondary visual cortex were also matched to their target areas. Thus, transmission of specific information to downstream targets may be a general feature of cortico-cortical communication.},

However, the effect of nucleus basalis activation on sensory processing remains poorly understood. Using polytrode recording in rat visual cortex, we found that nucleus basalis stimulation caused prominent decorrelation between neurons and marked improvement in the reliability of neuronal responses to natural scenes. The decorrelation depended on local activation of cortical muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, whereas the increased reliability involved distributed neural circuits, as evidenced by nucleus basalis-induced changes in thalamic responses. Further analysis showed that the decorrelation and increased reliability improved cortical representation of natural stimuli in a complementary manner. Thus, the basal forebrain neuromodulatory circuit, which is known to be activated during aroused and attentive states, acts through both local and distributed mechanisms to improve sensory coding.},

To elucidate the nature of this ongoing activity, we present a theoretical treatment of two contrasting scenarios of cortical dynamics: (1) fluctuations about a single background state and (2) wandering among multiple "attractor" states, which encode a single or several stimulus features. Studying simplified network rate models of the primary visual cortex (V1), we show that the single state scenario is characterized by fast and high-dimensional Gaussian-like fluctuations, whereas in the multiple state scenario the fluctuations are slow, low dimensional, and highly non-Gaussian. Studying a more realistic model that incorporates correlations in the feed-forward input, spatially restricted cortical interactions, and an experimentally derived layout of pinwheels, we show that recent optical-imaging data of ongoing activity in V1 are consistent with the presence of either a single background state or multiple attractor states encoding many features.},

abstract = {The majority of cortical interneurons use GABA (gamma amino butyric acid) as inhibitory neurotransmitter. GABAergic neurons are morphologically, connectionally, electrically and chemically heterogeneous. In rat cerebral cortex three distinct groups of GABAergic interneurons have been identified by the expression of parvalbumin (PV), calretinin (CR) and somatostatin (SOM). Recent studies in mouse cerebral cortex have revealed a different organization in which the CR and SOM populations are partially overlapping. Because CR and SOM neurons derive from different progenitors located in different embryonic structures, the coexpression of CR + SOM suggests that the chemical differentiation of interneurons is regulated postmitotically. Here, we have taken an important first step towards understanding this process by triple immunostaining mouse visual cortex with a panel of antibodies, which has been used extensively for classifying developing interneurons. We have found at least 13 distinct groups of GABAergic neurons which include PV, CR, SOM, CCK (cholecystokinin), CR + SOM, CR + NPY (neuropeptide Y), CR + VIP (vasointestinal polypeptide), SOM + NPY, SOM + VIP, VIP + ChAT (choline acetyltransferase), CCK + NPY, CR + SOM + NPY and CR + SOM + VIP expressing cells. Triple immunostaining with PV, CR and SOM antibodies during postnatal development further showed that PV is never colocalized with CR and SOM. Importantly, expression of SOM and CR + SOM developed after the percentage of CR cells that do not express SOM has reached the mature level, suggesting that the chemical differentiation of SOM and CR + SOM neurons is a postnatal event, which may be controlled by transcriptional regulation.},

abstract = {Processing of retinal images is carried out in the myriad dendritic arborizations of cortical neurons. Such processing involves complex dendritic integration of numerous inputs, and the subsequent output is transmitted to multiple targets by extensive axonal arbors. Thus far, details of this intricate processing remained unexaminable. This report describes the usefulness of real-time optical imaging in the study of population activity and the exploration of cortical dendritic processing. In contrast to single-unit recordings, optical signals primarily measure the changes in transmembrane potential of a population of neuronal elements, including the often elusive subthreshold synaptic potentials that impinge on the extensive arborization of cortical cells. By using small visual stimuli with sharp borders and real-time imaging of cortical responses, we found that shortly after its onset, cortical activity spreads from its retinotopic site of initiation, covering an area at least 10 times larger, in upper cortical layers. The activity spreads at velocities from 100 to 250 microns/msec. Near the V1/V2 border the direct activation is anisotropic and we detected also anisotropic spread; the "space constant" for the spread was approximately 2.7 mm parallel to the border and approximately 1.5 mm along the perpendicular axis. In addition, we found cortical interactions between cortical activities evoked by a small "center stimulus" and by large "surround stimuli" positioned outside the classical receptive field. All of the surround stimuli used suppressed the cortical response to the center stimulus. Under some stimulus conditions iso-orientation suppression was more pronounced than orthogonal-orientation suppression. The orientation dependence of the suppression and its dependency on the size of some specific stimuli indicate that at least part of the center surround inhibitory interaction was of cortical origin. This findings reported here raise the possibility that distributed processing over a very large cortical area plays a major role in the processing of visual information by the primary visual cortex of the primate.},

abstract = {Cortical neuromodulatory transmitter systems refer to those classical neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and monoamines, which share a number of common features. For instance, their centers are located in subcortical regions and send long projection axons to innervate the cortex. The same transmitter can either excite or inhibit cortical neurons depending on the composition of postsynaptic transmitter receptor subtypes. The overall functions of these transmitters are believed to serve as chemical bases of arousal, attention and motivation. The anatomy and physiology of neuromodulatory transmitter systems and their innervations in the cerebral cortex have been well characterized. In addition, ample evidence is available indicating that neuromodulatory transmitters also play roles in development and plasticity of the cortex. In this article, the anatomical organization and physiological function of each of the following neuromodulatory transmitters, acetylcholine, noradrenaline, serotonin, dopamine, and histamine, in the cortex will be described. The involvement of these transmitters in cortical plasticity will then be discussed. Available data suggest that neuromodulatory transmitters can modulate the excitability of cortical neurons, enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of cortical responses, and modify the threshold for activity-dependent synaptic modifications. Synaptic transmissions of these neuromodulatory transmitters are mediated via numerous subtype receptors, which are linked to multiple signal transduction mechanisms. Among the neuromodulatory transmitter receptor subtypes, cholinergic M(1), noradrenergic beta(1) and serotonergic 5-HT(2C) receptors appear to be more important than other receptor subtypes for cortical plasticity. In general, the contribution of neuromodulatory transmitter systems to cortical plasticity may be made through a facilitation of NMDA receptor-gated processes.},

abstract = {1. In an anesthetized, paralyzed in vivo preparation, we recorded extracellular responses of 61 geniculate neurons (2 W, 25 X, 33 Y, and 1 mixed) to drifting sine-wave gratings of various spatial frequency, temporal frequency, and contrast. Our goal was to study the differential contributions to these visual responses of bursting caused by voltage dependent, low-threshold (LT) Ca2+ spikes and of purely tonic responses unrelated to LT spikes. Cells responding with LT spikes are said to be in the burst firing mode and those responding in a purely tonic fashion to be in the relay or tonic firing mode. We separated the total visual response into LT burst and tonic components by use of the empirical criteria set forth in our intracellular study described in the previous paper (Lu et al. 1992). A response component was considered to be an LT burst if its action potentials displayed interspike intervals < or = 4 ms and if the first spike in the burst episode occurred after a silent period of > or = 100 ms (or > or = 50 ms when the neuron responds to visual stimuli at temporal rates > or = 8 Hz). All other activity is considered to be part of the tonic response. 2. In addition to LT bursts, we recognized another type of burst response, the high-threshold (HT) burst. These also have clusters of action potentials with interspike intervals < or = 4 ms. However, HT bursts, unlike LT bursts, lack a preburst silent period. HT bursts are part of the tonic response component and merely reflect the gradual decrease in interspike intervals that occurs as the cell becomes more depolarized and thus more responsive. Thus interspike interval is a necessary but insufficient criterion to identify LT bursts. 3. Visually evoked LT bursts were recorded among W, X, and Y cells. When evoked, LT bursts occurred in phase with drifting sine-wave grating stimuli at a rate never exceeding one per stimulus cycle. In response to individual cycles of the visual stimulus, LT bursts could comprise the total response, a tonic component could comprise the total response, or an LT burst and tonic component could be mixed. When a stimulus evoked a mixture of LT bursts and tonic response components, LT bursts were always the first response. 4. Of the 61 cells tested with grating stimuli, 47 exhibited LT bursts and 14 did not. Those that did exhibited varying amounts of burstiness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter critical for normal cognition. Here we demonstrate heterogeneity of cholinergic signaling in neocortical neurons in the rat prefrontal, somatosensory, and visual cortex. Focal ACh application (100 muM) inhibited layer 5 pyramidal neurons in all cortical areas via activation of an apamin-sensitive SK-type calcium-activated potassium conductance. Cholinergic inhibition was most robust in prefrontal layer 5 neurons, where it relies on the same signal transduction mechanism (M1-like receptors, IP(3)-dependent calcium release, and SK-channels) as exists in somatosensory pyramidal neurons. Pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 were less responsive to ACh, but substantial apamin-sensitive inhibitory responses occurred in deep layer 3 neurons of the visual cortex. ACh was only inhibitory when presented near the somata of layer 5 pyramidal neurons, where repetitive ACh applications generated discrete inhibitory events at frequencies of up to approximately 0.5 Hz. Fast-spiking (FS) nonpyramidal neurons in all cortical areas were unresponsive to ACh. When applied to non-FS interneurons in layers 2/3 and 5, ACh generated mecamylamine-sensitive nicotinic responses (38\% of cells), apamin-insensitive hyperpolarizing responses, with or without initial nicotinic depolarization (7\% of neurons), or no response at all (55\% of cells). Responses in interneurons were similar across cortical layers and regions but were correlated with cellular physiology and the expression of biochemical markers associated with different classes of nonpyramidal neurons. Finally, ACh generated nicotinic responses in all layer 1 neurons tested. These data demonstrate that phasic cholinergic input can directly inhibit projection neurons throughout the cortex while sculpting intracortical processing, especially in superficial layers.},

abstract = {Centre-surround interaction in the primary visual cortex (area V1) has been studied extensively using artificial, abstract stimulus patterns, such as bars, gratings and simple texture patterns. In this experiment, we extend the study of centre-surround interaction by using natural scene images. We systematically varied the contrast of natural image surrounds presented outside the classical receptive field (CRF), and recorded neuronal response to a natural image patch presented within the CRF in area V1 of awake, fixating macaques. For the majority of neurons (67 out of 111), the natural image surrounds profoundly modulated, mainly by suppressing, neuronal responses to CRF images. These modulatory effects started at the earliest stage of neuronal responses, and often depended on the contrast and higher-order structures of the surrounds. For 47 out of 67 neurons, randomising the phases of the Fourier spectrum of the natural image surround diminished the centre-surround interaction. Our results suggest that the centre-surround interaction in area V1 can be extended to natural vision, and is sensitive to the higher-order structures of natural scene images, such as image contours.},

abstract = {We present here a systematic mapping of nAChR subunit mRNAs in Macaca mulatta brain. A fragment, from the transmembrane segments MIII to MIV of Macaca neuronal nAChR subunits was cloned, and shown to exhibit high identity (around 95\%) to the corresponding human subunits. Then, specific oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized for in situ hybridization experiments. Both alpha4 and beta2 mRNA signals were widely distributed in the brain, being stronger in the thalamus and in the dopaminergic cells of the mesencephalon. Most brain nuclei displayed both alpha4 and beta2 signals with the exception of some basal ganglia regions and the reticular thalamic nucleus which were devoid of alpha4 signal. alpha6 and beta3 mRNA signals were selectively concentrated in the substantia nigra and the medial habenula. The strongest signals for alpha3 or beta4 mRNAs were found in the epithalamus (medial habenula and pineal gland), whereas there were no specific alpha3 or beta4 signals in mesencephalic dopaminergic nuclei. alpha5 and alpha7 mRNA signals were found in several brain areas, including cerebral cortex, thalamus and substantia nigra, although at a lower level than alpha4 and beta2. The distribution of alpha3, alpha4, alpha5, alpha6, alpha7, beta2, beta3 and beta4 subunit mRNAs in the monkey is substantially similar to that observed in rodent brain. Surprisingly, alpha2 mRNA signal was largely distributed in the Macaca brain, at levels comparable with those of alpha4 and beta2. This observation represents the main difference between rodent and Macaca subunit mRNA distribution and suggests that, besides alpha4beta2*, alpha2beta2* nAChRs constitute a main nAChR isoform in primate brain.},

abstract = {During visual system development, the light-insensitive retina spontaneously generates waves of activity, which are transmitted to the lateral geniculate nucleus. The crucial question is whether retinal waves are further transmitted to the cortex and influence the early cortical patterns of activity. Using simultaneous recordings from the rat retina and visual cortex during the first postnatal week in vivo, we found that spontaneous retinal bursts are correlated with spindle bursts (intermittent network bursts associated with spindle-shape field oscillations) in the contralateral visual cortex (V1). V1 spindle bursts could be evoked by electrical stimulation of the optic nerve. Intraocular injection of forskolin, which augments retinal waves, increased the occurrence of V1 spindle bursts. Blocking propagation of retinal activity, or removal of the retina reduced the frequency, but did not completely eliminate the cortical spindle bursts. These results indicate that spontaneous retinal waves are transmitted to the visual cortex and trigger endogenous spindle bursts. We propose that the interaction between retinal waves and spindle bursts contributes to the development of visual pathways to the cortex.},

To achieve this, it rapidly modulates the operating mode of cortical circuits, controlling the way that information is transformed and routed. This article will focus on two experimental approaches by which the control of cortical information processing has been investigated: the study of state-dependent cortical processing in rodents and attention in the primate visual system. Both processes involve a modulation of low-frequency activity fluctuations and spiking correlation, and are mediated by common receptor systems. We suggest that selective attention involves processes that are similar to state change, and that operate at a local columnar level to enhance the representation of otherwise non-salient features while suppressing internally generated activity patterns.},

abstract = {As indicated by the profound cognitive impairments caused by cholinergic receptor antagonists, cholinergic neurotransmission has a vital role in cognitive function, specifically attention and memory encoding. Abnormally regulated cholinergic neurotransmission has been hypothesized to contribute to the cognitive symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders. Loss of cholinergic neurons enhances the severity of the symptoms of dementia. Cholinergic receptor agonists and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have been investigated for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction. Evidence from experiments using new techniques for measuring rapid changes in cholinergic neurotransmission provides a novel perspective on the cholinergic regulation of cognitive processes. This evidence indicates that changes in cholinergic modulation on a timescale of seconds is triggered by sensory input cues and serves to facilitate cue detection and attentional performance. Furthermore, the evidence indicates cholinergic induction of evoked intrinsic, persistent spiking mechanisms for active maintenance of sensory input, and planned responses. Models have been developed to describe the neuronal mechanisms underlying the transient modulation of cortical target circuits by cholinergic activity. These models postulate specific locations and roles of nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and that cholinergic neurotransmission is controlled in part by (cortical) target circuits. The available evidence and these models point to new principles governing the development of the next generation of cholinergic treatments for cognitive disorders.},

The distinctiveness of the response to a given category was not due simply to the regions that responded maximally to that category, because the category being viewed also could be identified on the basis of the pattern of response when those regions were excluded from the analysis. Patterns of response that discriminated among all categories were found even within cortical regions that responded maximally to only one category.

abstract = {Many neurons in visual area V1 respond better to a pop-out stimulus, such as a single vertical bar among many horizontal bars, than to a homogeneous stimulus, such as a stimulus with all vertical bars. Many studies have suggested such cells represent neural correlates of pop-out, or more generally figure-ground segregation. However, preference for pop-out stimuli over homogeneous stimuli could also arise from a nonspecific selectivity for feature discontinuities between the target and the background, without any specificity for pop-out per se. To distinguish between these two confounding scenarios, we compared the responses of V1 neurons to pop-out stimuli with the responses to "conjunction-target" stimuli, which have more complex feature discontinuities between the target and the surround, as in a stimulus with a blue vertical bar among blue horizontal bars and yellow vertical bars. The target in conjunction-target stimuli does not pop out, which we psychophysically verified. V1 cells in general responded similarly to pop-out and conjunction-target stimuli, and only a small minority of cells (approximately 2\% by one measure) distinguished the pop-out and conjunction-target stimuli from each other and from homogeneous stimuli. Nevertheless, the responses of approximately 50\% of the cells were significantly modulated across all center-surround stimuli, indicating that V1 cells can convey information about the feature discontinuities between the center and the surround as part of a network of neurons, although individual cells by themselves fail to explicitly represent pop-out. In light of our results, unambiguous pop-out selectivity at the level of individual cells remains to be demonstrated in V1 or elsewhere in the visual cortex.},

abstract = {The input, processing, and output characteristics of inhibitory interneurons help shape information flow through layers 2/3 of the visual cortex. Parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons modulate and synchronize the gain and dynamic responsiveness of pyramidal neurons. To define the diversity of PV interneurons in layers 2/3 of the developing visual cortex, we characterized their passive and active membrane properties. Using Ward's and k-means multidimensional clustering, we identified four PV interneuron subgroups. The most notable difference between the subgroups was their firing patterns in response to moderate stimuli just above rheobase. Two subgroups showed regular and continuous firing at all stimulus intensities above rheobase. The difference between these two continuously firing subgroups was that one fired at much higher frequencies and transitioned into this high-frequency firing rate at or near rheobase. The two other subgroups showed irregular, stuttering firing patterns just above rheobase. Both of these subgroups typically transitioned to regular and continuous firing at intense stimulations, but one of these subgroups, the strongly stuttering subgroup, showed irregular firing across a wider range of stimulus intensities and firing frequencies. The four subgroups also differed in excitatory synaptic input, providing independent support for the classification of subgroups. The subgroups of PV interneurons identified here would respond differently to inputs of varying intensity and frequency, generating diverse patterns of PV inhibition in the developing neural circuit.},

abstract = {A key property of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) is the distinction between simple and complex cells. Recent reports in cat visual cortex indicate the categorization of simple and complex can change depending on stimulus conditions. We investigated the stability of the simple/complex classification with changes in drive produced by either contrast or modulation by the extraclassical receptive field (eCRF). These two conditions were reported to increase the proportion of simple cells in cat cortex. The ratio of the modulation depth of the response (F1) to the elevation of response (F0) to a drifting grating (F1/F0 ratio) was used as the measure of simple/complex. The majority of V1 complex cells remained classified as complex with decreasing contrast. Near contrast threshold, an equal proportion of simple and complex cells changed their classification. The F1/F0 ratio was stable between optimal and large stimulus areas even for those neurons that showed strong eCRF suppression. There was no discernible overall effect of surrounding spatial context on the F1/F0 ratio. Simple/complex cell classification is relatively stable across a range of stimulus drives, produced by either contrast or eCRF suppression.},

abstract = {Attention exerts a strong influence over neuronal processing in cortical areas. It selectively increases firing rates and affects tuning properties, including changing receptive field locations and sizes. Although these effects are well studied, their cellular mechanisms are poorly understood. To study the cellular mechanisms, we combined iontophoretic pharmacological analysis of cholinergic receptors with single cell recordings in V1 while rhesus macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) performed a task that demanded top-down spatial attention. Attending to the receptive field of the V1 neuron under study caused an increase in firing rates. Here we show that this attentional modulation was enhanced by low doses of acetylcholine. Furthermore, applying the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine reduced attentional modulation, whereas the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine had no systematic effect. These results demonstrate that muscarinic cholinergic mechanisms play a central part in mediating the effects of attention in V1.},

There is now an accumulation of psychophysical and neurophysiological evidence that the outputs of cells with conjoint orientation preference and spatial position are integrated in the process of explication of rudimentary contours. Recent neuroanatomical and neurophysiological results suggest that this process takes place at the cortical level V1. The code for contour integration may be a temporal one in that it may only manifest itself in the latter part of the spike train as a result of feedback and lateral interactions. Here we review some of the properties of contour integration from a psychophysical perspective and we speculate on their underlying neurophysiological substrate.},

abstract = {Horizontal connections are a principal component of intrinsic cortical circuitry. They arise mainly from pyramidal cells and course parallel to the brain's surface for distances as long as 8 mm, linking columns with shared orientation preference and allowing cells to integrate visual information from outside their receptive fields. We examined the synaptic physiology of the horizontal pathway in slices of the cat's striate cortex and found that activating lateral fibers produced both excitation and inhibition. We recorded the postsynaptic responses of identified pyramidal cells in layer 2 + 3 of area 17 to electrical shocks applied at three sites: in the home column of the impaled neuron either in layer 2 + 3 or 4, or at a lateral distance of 0.9-3 mm in layer 2 + 3. Within the home column, suprathreshold stimuli produced compound EPSPs with action potentials, followed by fast, GABAAergic IPSPs and a slower, GABABergic IPSP. For the distant stimulating site, the threshold response was an EPSP. Stronger shocks frequently evoked a disynaptic, GABAAergic IPSP that truncated the EPSP and could dominate the postsynaptic response. At the resting potential, the horizontally evoked EPSP was too small to elicit spikes. With depolarization of the membrane, however, it grew several hundred-fold. This amplification was blocked by N-(2,6-dimethylphenylcarbamoylmethyl)triethylammonium bromide (QX-314), but not by 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV), indicating that it was mediated by Na+ channels, rather than by NMDA receptors. We propose that the horizontal connections provide the means for stimuli outside the receptive field to modulate activity elicited within its confines. The voltage-dependent enhancement of the laterally evoked EPSP may explain why stimulating the surround by itself fails to drive cells but can facilitate their response to stimuli within the receptive field. The ability to initiate disynaptic inhibition from lateral sites shows that recruiting appropriate groups of horizontal fibers can also have a suppressive effect. Thus, the effect of horizontal input is state dependent, with the size and sign of the laterally evoked response changing according to the balance of converging inputs.},

Interest in how sensitivity to different stimulus features first emerges in the columns and how this selectivity is refined by subsequent processing has fueled decades of research. A natural starting point in approaching these issues is anatomy. Each column traverses the six cortical layers and each layer has a unique pattern of inputs, intrinsic connections and outputs. Thus, it makes sense to explore the possibility of corresponding laminar differences in sensory function, that is, to examine relationships between morphology and physiology. In addition, to help identify general patterns of cortical organization, it is useful to compare results obtained from different sensory systems and diverse species. The picture that emerges from such comparisons is that each cortical layer serves a distinct role in sensory function. Furthermore, different cortices appear to share some common strategies for processing information but also have specialized mechanisms adapted for the demands of specific sensory tasks.},

Our immediate aim was to explore the inhibitory mechanisms that contribute to orientation selectivity, perhaps the most dramatic response property to emerge across the thalamocortical synapse. The broader goal was to understand how inhibitory circuits operate. Using whole-cell recording in cats in vivo, we found that layer 4 contains two populations of inhibitory cells defined by receptive field class--simple and complex. The simple cells were selective for stimulus orientation, whereas the complex cells were not. Our observations help to explain how neurons become sensitive to stimulus orientation and maintain that selectivity as stimulus contrast changes. Overall, the work suggests that different sources of inhibition, either selective for specific features or broadly tuned, interact to provide appropriate representations of elements within the environment.},

abstract = {Using high-resolution adaptive-optics imaging combined with retinal densitometry, we characterized the arrangement of short- (S), middle- (M), and long- (L) wavelength-sensitive cones in eight human foveal mosaics. As suggested by previous studies, we found males with normal color vision that varied in the ratio of L to M cones (from 1.1:1 to 16.5:1). We also found a protan carrier with an even more extreme L:M ratio (0.37:1). All subjects had nearly identical S-cone densities, indicating independence of the developmental mechanism that governs the relative numerosity of L/M and S cones. L:M cone ratio estimates were correlated highly with those obtained in the same eyes using the flicker photometric electroretinogram (ERG), although the comparison indicates that the signal from each M cone makes a larger contribution to the ERG than each L cone. Although all subjects had highly disordered arrangements of L and M cones, three subjects showed evidence for departures from a strictly random rule for assigning the L and M cone photopigments. In two retinas, these departures corresponded to local clumping of cones of like type. In a third retina, the L:M cone ratio differed significantly at two retinal locations on opposite sides of the fovea. These results suggest that the assignment of L and M pigment, although highly irregular, is not a completely random process. Surprisingly, in the protan carrier, in which X-chromosome inactivation would favor L- or M-cone clumping, there was no evidence of clumping, perhaps as a result of cone migration during foveal development.},

How these intrinsic and extrinsic factors govern the activity of excitatory and inhibitory populations is unclear. Using two-photon calcium imaging in vivo and intracellular recordings in vitro, we investigated the dependencies between synaptic connectivity, feature selectivity and network activity in pyramidal cells and fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons in mouse visual cortex. In pyramidal cell populations, patterns of neuronal correlations were largely stimulus-dependent, indicating that their responses were not strongly dominated by functionally biased recurrent connectivity. By contrast, visual stimulation only weakly modified co-activation patterns of fast-spiking PV cells, consistent with the observation that these broadly tuned interneurons received very dense and strong synaptic input from nearby pyramidal cells with diverse feature selectivities. Therefore, feedforward and recurrent network influences determine the activity of excitatory and inhibitory ensembles in fundamentally different ways.},

abstract = {This year, the field of neuroscience celebrates the 50th anniversary of Mountcastle's discovery of the cortical column. In this review, we summarize half a century of research and come to the disappointing realization that the column may have no function. Originally, it was described as a discrete structure, spanning the layers of the somatosensory cortex, which contains cells responsive to only a single modality, such as deep joint receptors or cutaneous receptors. Subsequently, examples of columns have been uncovered in numerous cortical areas, expanding the original concept to embrace a variety of different structures and principles. A "column" now refers to cells in any vertical cluster that share the same tuning for any given receptive field attribute. In striate cortex, for example, cells with the same eye preference are grouped into ocular dominance columns. Unaccountably, ocular dominance columns are present in some species, but not others. In principle, it should be possible to determine their function by searching for species differences in visual performance that correlate with their presence or absence. Unfortunately, this approach has been to no avail; no visual faculty has emerged that appears to require ocular dominance columns. Moreover, recent evidence has shown that the expression of ocular dominance columns can be highly variable among members of the same species, or even in different portions of the visual cortex in the same individual. These observations deal a fatal blow to the idea that ocular dominance columns serve a purpose. More broadly, the term "column" also denotes the periodic termination of anatomical projections within or between cortical areas. In many instances, periodic projections have a consistent relationship with some architectural feature, such as the cytochrome oxidase patches in V1 or the stripes in V2. These tissue compartments appear to divide cells with different receptive field properties into distinct processing streams. However, it is unclear what advantage, if any, is conveyed by this form of columnar segregation. Although the column is an attractive concept, it has failed as a unifying principle for understanding cortical function. Unravelling the organization of the cerebral cortex will require a painstaking description of the circuits, projections and response properties peculiar to cells in each of its various areas.},

@article{Hubel1968,
abstract = {1. The striate cortex was studied in lightly anaesthetized macaque and spider monkeys by recording extracellularly from single units and stimulating the retinas with spots or patterns of light. Most cells can be categorized as simple, complex, or hypercomplex, with response properties very similar to those previously described in the cat. On the average, however, receptive fields are smaller, and there is a greater sensitivity to changes in stimulus orientation. A small proportion of the cells are colour coded.2. Evidence is presented for at least two independent systems of columns extending vertically from surface to white matter. Columns of the first type contain cells with common receptive-field orientations. They are similar to the orientation columns described in the cat, but are probably smaller in cross-sectional area. In the second system cells are aggregated into columns according to eye preference. The ocular dominance columns are larger than the orientation columns, and the two sets of boundaries seem to be independent.3. There is a tendency for cells to be grouped according to symmetry of responses to movement; in some regions the cells respond equally well to the two opposite directions of movement of a line, but other regions contain a mixture of cells favouring one direction and cells favouring the other.4. A horizontal organization corresponding to the cortical layering can also be discerned. The upper layers (II and the upper two-thirds of III) contain complex and hypercomplex cells, but simple cells are virtually absent. The cells are mostly binocularly driven. Simple cells are found deep in layer III, and in IV A and IV B. In layer IV B they form a large proportion of the population, whereas complex cells are rare. In layers IV A and IV B one finds units lacking orientation specificity; it is not clear whether these are cell bodies or axons of geniculate cells. In layer IV most cells are driven by one eye only; this layer consists of a mosaic with cells of some regions responding to one eye only, those of other regions responding to the other eye. Layers V and VI contain mostly complex and hypercomplex cells, binocularly driven.5. The cortex is seen as a system organized vertically and horizontally in entirely different ways. In the vertical system (in which cells lying along a vertical line in the cortex have common features) stimulus dimensions such as retinal position, line orientation, ocular dominance, and perhaps directionality of movement, are mapped in sets of superimposed but independent mosaics. The horizontal system segregates cells in layers by hierarchical orders, the lowest orders (simple cells monocularly driven) located in and near layer IV, the higher orders in the upper and lower layers.},

These connections dictate the receptive field properties of individual visual neurons and ultimately determine the quality of visual perception. Spontaneous neural activity is necessary for the development of various receptive field properties and visual feature maps. In recent years, attention has shifted to understanding the mechanisms by which spontaneous activity in the developing retina, lateral geniculate nucleus, and visual cortex instruct the axonal and dendritic refinements that give rise to orderly connections in the visual system. Axon guidance cues and a growing list of other molecules, including immune system factors, have also recently been implicated in visual circuit wiring. A major goal now is to determine how these molecules cooperate with spontaneous and visually evoked activity to give rise to the circuits underlying precise receptive field tuning and orderly visual maps.},

One particularly important early process in visual object recognition is that of grouping together edges which belong to the same contour. The layout of edges in natural scenes have strong statistical structure. One such statistical property is that edges tend to lie on a common circle, and this 'co-circularity' can predict human performance at contour grouping. We therefore tested the hypothesis that long-range excitatory lateral connections in the primary visual cortex, which are believed to be involved in contour grouping, display a similar co-circular structure.},

abstract = {In primary visual cortex (V1), neuronal responses to optimally oriented stimuli in the receptive field (RF) center are usually suppressed by iso-oriented stimuli in the RF surround. The mechanisms and pathways giving rise to surround modulation, a possible neural correlate of perceptual figure-ground segregation, are not yet identified. We previously proposed that highly divergent and fast-conducting top-down feedback connections are the substrate for fast modulation arising from the more distant regions of the surround. We have recently implemented this idea into a recurrent network model (Schwabe et al. 2006). The purpose of this study was to test a crucial prediction of this feedback model, namely that the suppressive "far" surround of V1 neurons can be facilitatory under conditions that weakly activate neurons in the RF center. Using single-unit recordings in macaque V1, we found iso-orientation far-surround facilitation when the RF center was driven by a low-contrast stimulus and the far surround by a small annular stimulus. Suppression occurred when the center stimulus contrast or the size of the surround stimulus was increased. This suggests that center-surround interactions result from excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms of similar spatial extent, and that changes in the balance of local excitation and inhibition, induced by surround stimulation, determine whether facilitation or suppression occurs. In layer 4C, the main target of geniculocortical afferents, lacking long-range intra-cortical connections, far-surround facilitation was rare and large surround fields were absent. This strongly suggests that feedforward connections do not contribute to far-surround modulation and that the latter is generated by intra-cortical mechanisms, likely involving top-down feedback.},

abstract = {Five important trends have emerged from recent work on computational models of focal visual attention that emphasize the bottom-up, image-based control of attentional deployment. First, the perceptual saliency of stimuli critically depends on the surrounding context. Second, a unique 'saliency map' that topographically encodes for stimulus conspicuity over the visual scene has proved to be an efficient and plausible bottom-up control strategy. Third, inhibition of return, the process by which the currently attended location is prevented from being attended again, is a crucial element of attentional deployment. Fourth, attention and eye movements tightly interplay, posing computational challenges with respect to the coordinate system used to control attention. And last, scene understanding and object recognition strongly constrain the selection of attended locations. Insights from these five key areas provide a framework for a computational and neurobiological understanding of visual attention.},

abstract = {We propose a formal Bayesian definition of surprise to capture subjective aspects of sensory information. Surprise measures how data affects an observer, in terms of differences between posterior and prior beliefs about the world. Only data observations which substantially affect the observer's beliefs yield surprise, irrespectively of how rare or informative in Shannon's sense these observations are. We test the framework by quantifying the extent to which humans may orient attention and gaze towards surprising events or items while watching television. To this end, we implement a simple computational model where a low-level, sensory form of surprise is computed by simple simulated early visual neurons. Bayesian surprise is a strong attractor of human attention, with 72\% of all gaze shifts directed towards locations more surprising than the average, a figure rising to 84\% when focusing the analysis onto regions simultaneously selected by all observers. The proposed theory of surprise is applicable across different spatio-temporal scales, modalities, and levels of abstraction.},

abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used while normal human volunteers engaged in simple detection and discrimination tasks, revealing separable modulations of early visual cortex associated with spatial attention and task structure. Both modulations occur even when there is no change in sensory stimulation. The modulation due to spatial attention is present throughout the early visual areas V1, V2, V3, and VP, and varies with the attended location. The task structure activations are strongest in V1 and are greater in regions that represent more peripheral parts of the visual field. Control experiments demonstrate that the task structure activations cannot be attributed to visual, auditory, or somatosensory processing, the motor response for the detection/discrimination judgment, or oculomotor responses such as blinks or saccades. These findings demonstrate that early visual areas are modulated by at least two types of endogenous signals, each with distinct cortical distributions.},

abstract = {The advent of transgenic mice has made the developing retinogeniculate pathway a model system for targeting potential mechanisms that underlie the refinement of sensory connections. However, a detailed characterization of the form and function of this pathway is lacking. Here we use a variety of anatomical and electrophysiological techniques to delineate the structural and functional changes occurring in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of dorsal thalamus of the C57/BL6 mouse. During the first two postnatal weeks there is an age-related recession in the amount of terminal space occupied by retinal axons arising from the two eyes. During the first postnatal week, crossed and uncrossed axons show substantial overlap throughout most of the LGN. Between the first and second week retinal arbors show significant pruning, so that by the time of natural eye opening (P12-14) segregation is complete and retinal projections are organized into distinct eye-specific domains. During this time of rapid anatomical rearrangement, LGN cells could be readily distinguished using immunocytochemical markers that stain for NMDA receptors, GABA receptors, L-type Ca2+ channels, and the neurofilament protein SMI-32. Moreover, the membrane properties and synaptic responses of developing LGN cells are remarkably stable and resemble those of mature neurons. However, there are some notable developmental changes in synaptic connectivity. At early ages, LGN cells are binocularly responsive and receive input from as many as 11 different retinal ganglion cells. Optic tract stimulation also evokes plateau-like depolarizations that are mediated by the activation of L-type Ca2+ channels. As retinal inputs from the two eyes segregate into nonoverlapping territories, there is a loss of binocular responsiveness, a decrease in retinal convergence, and a reduction in the incidence of plateau potentials. These data serve as a working framework for the assessment of phenotypes of genetically altered strains as well as provide some insight as to the molecular mechanisms underlying the refinement of retinogeniculate connections.},

abstract = {Electrical stimulation of retinal neurons with an advanced retinal prosthesis may eventually provide high-resolution artificial vision to the blind. However, the success of future prostheses depends on the ability to activate the major parallel visual pathways of the human visual system. Electrical stimulation of the five numerically dominant retinal ganglion cell types was investigated by simultaneous stimulation and recording in isolated peripheral primate (Macaca sp.) retina using multi-electrode arrays. ON and OFF midget, ON and OFF parasol, and small bistratified ganglion cells could all be activated directly to fire a single spike with submillisecond latency using brief pulses of current within established safety limits. Thresholds for electrical stimulation were similar in all five cell types. In many cases, a single cell could be specifically activated without activating neighboring cells of the same type or other types. These findings support the feasibility of direct electrical stimulation of the major visual pathways at or near their native spatial and temporal resolution.},

abstract = {Motion vision is a major function of all visual systems, yet the underlying neural mechanisms and circuits are still elusive. In the lamina, the first optic neuropile of Drosophila melanogaster, photoreceptor signals split into five parallel pathways, L1-L5. Here we examine how these pathways contribute to visual motion detection by combining genetic block and reconstitution of neural activity in different lamina cell types with whole-cell recordings from downstream motion-sensitive neurons. We find reduced responses to moving gratings if L1 or L2 is blocked; however, reconstitution of photoreceptor input to only L1 or L2 results in wild-type responses. Thus, the first experiment indicates the necessity of both pathways, whereas the second indicates sufficiency of each single pathway. This contradiction can be explained by electrical coupling between L1 and L2, allowing for activation of both pathways even when only one of them receives photoreceptor input. A fundamental difference between the L1 pathway and the L2 pathway is uncovered when blocking L1 or L2 output while presenting moving edges of positive (ON) or negative (OFF) contrast polarity: blocking L1 eliminates the response to moving ON edges, whereas blocking L2 eliminates the response to moving OFF edges. Thus, similar to the segregation of photoreceptor signals in ON and OFF bipolar cell pathways in the vertebrate retina, photoreceptor signals segregate into ON-L1 and OFF-L2 channels in the lamina of Drosophila.},

abstract = {Perceptually, color is used to discriminate objects by hue and to identify color boundaries. The primate retina and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) have cell populations sensitive to color modulation, but the role of the primary visual cortex (V1) in color signal processing is uncertain. We re-evaluated color processing in V1 by studying single-neuron responses to luminance and to equiluminant color patterns equated for cone contrast. Many neurons respond robustly to both equiluminant color and luminance modulation (color-luminance cells). Also, there are neurons that prefer luminance (luminance cells), and a few neurons that prefer color (color cells). Surprisingly, most color-luminance cells are spatial-frequency tuned, with approximately equal selectivity for chromatic and achromatic patterns. Therefore, V1 retains the color sensitivity provided by the LGN, and adds spatial selectivity for color boundaries.},

abstract = {The basal forebrain constitutes the ventral extra-thalamic relay from the brainstem activating system to the cerebral cortex. Cholinergic neurons form an important contingent of this relay, yet represent only a portion of the cortically projecting and other basal forebrain neurons, which include GABAergic neurons. By recording, labeling and identifying neurons by their neurotransmitter first in vitro and then in vivo, we have determined that the cholinergic neurons have different physiological and pharmacological properties than other codistributed neurons. Cholinergic neurons discharge at higher rates during cortical activation than during cortical slow wave activity, and are excited by transmitters released from brainstem afferent neurons, including glutamate from reticular formation, noradrenaline (NA) from locus coeruleus, and orexin and histamine from posterior hypothalamus. In contrast, particular GABAergic neurons discharge at higher rates during cortical slow wave activity and are inhibited by NA. When NA is administered into the basal forebrain in naturally sleeping-waking rats, it elicits an increase in fast gamma EEG activity and diminution of slow delta EEG activity while promoting waking and eliminating slow wave sleep (SWS). Cholinergic neurons also have the capacity to discharge in rhythmic bursts when activated by particular agonists, notably neurotensin (NT). When NT is administered into the basal forebrain, it stimulates theta activity in addition to gamma while promoting waking and paradoxical sleep (PS). By increasing discharge and firing in rhythmic bursts in response to transmitters of the activating systems, cholinergic neurons can thus stimulate cortical activation with gamma and theta activity along with the states of waking and PS. Colocalized GABAergic basal forebrain neurons which are inhibited by transmitters of the arousal systems can oppose these actions and promote delta activity and SWS.},

abstract = {We have explored the spatial organization of orientation contrast effects in primate V1. Our stimuli were either concentric patches of drifting grating of varying orientation and diameter or grating patches displaced in x-y coordinates around a central patch overlying the classical receptive field (CRF). All cells in the sample exhibited response suppression to iso-oriented stimuli exceeding the CRF. Changing the outer stimulus orientation revealed five response patterns: 1) orientation alignment suppression (17\% of cells)-a suppressive component tuned to the same orientation as the cell's optimal, 2) orientation contrast facilitation (63\%)-responses to orientation contrast stimuli exceeded those to the center stimulus alone, 3) nonorientation specific suppression (3\%), 4) mixed general suppression and alignment suppression (14\%), and 5) orientation contrast suppression (14\%)-cross-oriented stimuli evoked stronger suppression than iso-oriented stimuli. Thus most cells (94\%) showed larger responses to orientation contrast stimuli than to iso-oriented stimuli, and over one-half showed orientation contrast facilitation. There appeared to be a spatially structured organization of the zones driving the different response patterns with respect to the CRF. Nonorientation-specific suppression and orientation contrast suppression were predominantly evoked by orientation contrast borders located within the CRF, and orientation contrast facilitation was mainly driven by surround stimuli lying outside the CRF. This led to different response patterns according to border location. Zones driving orientation contrast facilitation were not necessarily contiguous to, nor uniformly distributed around, the CRF. Our data support two processes underlying orientation contrast enhancement effects: a simple variation in the strength of surround suppression drawing on the fact that surround suppression is tuned to the same orientation as the CRF and a second process driven by orientation contrast that enhanced cells' responses to CRF stimulation by either dis-inhibition or orientation contrast facilitation. We suggest these processes may serve to enhance response levels to salient image features such as junctions and corners and may contribute to orientation pop-out.},

abstract = {The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) serves as the primary conduit of retinal information to visual cortex. In addition to retinal input, dLGN receives a large feedback projection from layer VI of visual cortex. Such input modulates thalamic signal transmission in different ways that range from gain control to synchronizing network activity in a stimulus-specific manner. However, the mechanisms underlying such modulation have been difficult to study, in part because of the complex circuitry and diverse cell types this pathway innervates. To address this and overcome some of the technical limitations inherent in studying the corticothalamic (CT) pathway, we adopted a slice preparation in which we were able to stimulate CT terminal arbors in the visual thalamus of the mouse with blue light by using an adeno-associated virus to express the light-gated ion channel, ChIEF, in layer VI neurons. To examine the postsynaptic responses evoked by repetitive CT stimulation, we recorded from identified relay cells in dLGN, as well as GFP expressing GABAergic neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and intrinsic interneurons of dLGN. Relay neurons exhibited large glutamatergic responses that continued to increase in amplitude with each successive stimulus pulse. While excitatory responses were apparent at postnatal day 10, the strong facilitation noted in adult was not observed until postnatal day 21. GABAergic neurons in TRN exhibited large initial excitatory responses that quickly plateaued during repetitive stimulation, indicating that the degree of facilitation was much larger for relay cells than for TRN neurons. The responses of intrinsic interneurons were smaller and took the form of a slow depolarization. These differences in the pattern of excitation for different thalamic cell types should help provide a framework for understanding how CT feedback alters the activity of visual thalamic circuitry during sensory processing as well as different behavioral or pathophysiological states.},

This face activation was used to define a specific region of interest individually for each subject, within which several new tests of face specificity were run. In each of five subjects tested, the predefined candidate "face area" also responded significantly more strongly to passive viewing of (1) intact than scrambled two-tone faces, (2) full front-view face photos than front-view photos of houses, and (in a different set of five subjects) (3) three-quarter-view face photos (with hair concealed) than photos of human hands; it also responded more strongly during (4) a consecutive matching task performed on three-quarter-view faces versus hands. Our technique of running multiple tests applied to the same region defined functionally within individual subjects provides a solution to two common problems in functional imaging: (1) the requirement to correct for multiple statistical comparisons and (2) the inevitable ambiguity in the interpretation of any study in which only two or three conditions are compared. Our data allow us to reject alternative accounts of the function of the fusiform face area (area "FF") that appeal to visual attention, subordinate-level classification, or general processing of any animate or human forms, demonstrating that this region is selectively involved in the perception of faces.},

Recordings from V1 showed that 42\% of complex cells demonstrated facilitation for a second bar outside their classical receptive fields with a similar dependency on relative location and orientation. Both effects were eliminated by an orthogonal line between the two iso-oriented lines. Multiple randomly placed and oriented lines in the receptive field surround often caused a reduction in a cell's response to an optimally oriented stimulus, but this inhibition could be eliminated by changing the orientation of a few of these elements to colinearity with the centrally located target.},

On average, the length of the excitatory RF was 4-fold greater for a low-contrast stimulus than for a stimulus at high contrast. Embedding a high-contrast stimulus in a textured background tended to suppress neuronal responses and produced an enlargement in RF size similar to that observed by decreasing the contrast of an isolated stimulus.

abstract = {The balance between excitation and inhibition in the cortex is crucial in determining sensory processing. Because the amount of excitation varies, maintaining this balance is a dynamic process; yet the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We show here that the activity of even a single layer 2/3 pyramidal cell in the somatosensory cortex of the rat generates widespread inhibition that increases disproportionately with the number of active pyramidal neurons. This supralinear increase of inhibition results from the incremental recruitment of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory interneurons located in layers 2/3 and 5. The recruitment of these interneurons increases tenfold when they are excited by two pyramidal cells. A simple model demonstrates that the distribution of excitatory input amplitudes onto inhibitory neurons influences the sensitivity and dynamic range of the recurrent circuit. These data show that through a highly sensitive recurrent inhibitory circuit, cortical excitability can be modulated by one pyramidal cell.},

abstract = {Our aim was to reveal the relationship between layer IV horizontal connections and the functional architecture of the cat primary visual cortex because these connections play important roles in the first cortical stage of visual signals integration. We investigated bouton distribution of spiny neurons over an orientation preference map using in vivo optical imaging, unit recordings, and single neuron reconstructions. The radial extent of reconstructed axons (14 star pyramidal and 9 spiny stellate cells) was \~{}1.5 mm. In the vicinity of the parent somata (<400 $\mu$m), boutons occupied chiefly iso-orientations, however, more distally, 7 cells projected preferentially to non-iso-orientations. Boutons of each cell were partitioned into 1-15 distinct clusters based on the mean-shift algorithm, of which 57 clusters preferred iso-orientations and 43 clusters preferred cross-orientations, each showing sharp orientation preference "tuning." However, unlike layer III/V pyramidal cells preferring chiefly iso-orientations, layer IV cells were engaged with broad orientations because each bouton cluster from the same cell could show different orientation preference. These results indicate that the circuitry of layer IV spiny cells is organized differently from that of iso-orientation dominant layer III/V cells and probably processes visual signals in a different manner from that of the superficial and deeper layers.},

abstract = {GABA(A) inhibition is thought to play multiple roles in sensory cortex, such as controlling responsiveness and sensitivity, sharpening selectivity, and mediating competitive interactions. To test these proposals, we recorded in cat primary visual cortex (V1) after local iontophoresis of gabazine, the selective GABA(A) antagonist. Gabazine increased responsiveness by as much as 300\%. It slightly decreased selectivity for stimulus orientation and direction, often by raising responses to all orientations. Strikingly, gabazine affected neither contrast sensitivity nor cross-orientation suppression, the competition seen when stimuli of different orientation are superimposed. These results were captured by a simple model in which GABA(A) inhibition has the same selectivity as excitation and keeps responses to unwanted stimuli below threshold. We conclude that GABA(A) inhibition in V1 helps enhance stimulus selectivity but is not responsible for competition among superimposed stimuli. It controls the sensitivity of V1 neurons by adjusting their response gain, without affecting their input gain.},

abstract = {A challenging goal in neuroscience is to be able to read out, or decode, mental content from brain activity. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have decoded orientation, position and object category from activity in visual cortex. However, these studies typically used relatively simple stimuli (for example, gratings) or images drawn from fixed categories (for example, faces, houses), and decoding was based on previous measurements of brain activity evoked by those same stimuli or categories. To overcome these limitations, here we develop a decoding method based on quantitative receptive-field models that characterize the relationship between visual stimuli and fMRI activity in early visual areas. These models describe the tuning of individual voxels for space, orientation and spatial frequency, and are estimated directly from responses evoked by natural images. We show that these receptive-field models make it possible to identify, from a large set of completely novel natural images, which specific image was seen by an observer. Identification is not a mere consequence of the retinotopic organization of visual areas; simpler receptive-field models that describe only spatial tuning yield much poorer identification performance. Our results suggest that it may soon be possible to reconstruct a picture of a person's visual experience from measurements of brain activity alone.},

abstract = {We study a recently proposed "correlation-based," push-pull model of the circuitry of layer 4 of cat visual cortex. This model was previously shown to explain the contrast-invariance of cortical orientation tuning. Here we show that it can simultaneously account for several contrast-dependent (c-d) "nonlinearities" in cortical responses. These include an advance with increasing contrast in the temporal phase of response to a sinusoidally modulated stimulus; a change in shape of the temporal frequency tuning curve, so that higher temporal frequencies may give little or no response at low contrast but reasonable responses at high contrast; and contrast saturation that occurs at lower contrasts in cortex than in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). In the context of the model circuit, these properties arise from a mixture of nonlinear cellular and synaptic mechanisms: short-term synaptic depression, spike-rate adaptation, contrast-induced changes in cellular conductance, and the nonzero spike threshold. The former three mechanisms are sufficient to explain the experimentally observed increase in c-d phase advance in cortex relative to LGN. The c-d changes in temporal frequency tuning arise as a threshold effect: voltage modulations in response to higher-frequency inputs are only slightly above threshold at lower contrast, but become robustly suprathreshold at higher contrast. The other three nonlinear mechanisms also play a crucial role in this result, allowing contrast dependence of temporal frequency tuning to coexist with contrast-invariance of orientation tuning. Contrast saturation, and the observation that responses to stimuli of increasing temporal frequency saturate at increasingly high contrasts, can be induced both by the model's push-pull inhibition and by synaptic depression. Previous proposals explained these nonlinear response properties by assuming contrast-invariant orientation tuning as a starting point, and adding normalization by shunting inhibition derived equally from cells of all preferred orientations. The present proposal simultaneously explains both contrast-invariant orientation tuning and these contrast-dependent nonlinearities and requires only processing that is local in orientation, in agreement with intracellular measurements.},

The observed thalamocortical and intracortical circuitry codevelop under Hebb-like synaptic plasticity. Hebbian development yields opponent inhibition: inhibition evoked by stimuli anticorrelated with those that excite a cell. Strong opponent inhibition enables recognition of stimulus orientation in a manner invariant to stimulus contrast. These principles may apply to cortex more generally: Hebb-like plasticity can guide layer 4 of any piece of cortex to create opposition between anticorrelated stimulus pairs, and this enables recognition of specific stimulus patterns in a manner invariant to stimulus magnitude. Properties that are invariant across a cortical column are predicted to be those shared by opponent stimulus pairs; this contrasts with the common idea that a column represents cells with similar response properties.},

abstract = {It is well established that spatially directed attention enhances visual perceptual processing. However, the earliest level at which processing can be affected remains unknown. To date, there has been no report of modulation of the earliest visual event-related potential component "C1" in humans, which indexes initial afference in primary visual cortex (V1). Thus it has been suggested that initial V1 activity is impenetrable, and that the earliest modulations occur in extrastriate cortex. However, the C1 is highly variable across individuals, to the extent that uniform measurement across a group may poorly reflect the dynamics of V1 activity. In the present study we employed an individualized mapping procedure to control for such variability. Parameters for optimal C1 measurement were determined in an independent, preliminary "probe" session and later applied in a follow-up session involving a spatial cueing task. In the spatial task, subjects were cued on each trial to direct attention toward 1 of 2 locations in anticipation of an imperative Gabor stimulus and were required to detect a region of lower luminance appearing within the Gabor pattern 30\% of the time at the cued location only. Our data show robust spatial attentional enhancement of the C1, beginning as early as its point of onset (57 ms). Source analysis of the attentional modulations points to generation in striate cortex. This finding demonstrates that at the very moment that visual information first arrives in cortex, it is already being shaped by the brain's attentional biases.},

abstract = {Spontaneous cortical activity--ongoing activity in the absence of intentional sensory input--has been studied extensively, using methods ranging from EEG (electroencephalography), through voltage sensitive dye imaging, down to recordings from single neurons. Ongoing cortical activity has been shown to play a critical role in development, and must also be essential for processing sensory perception, because it modulates stimulus-evoked activity, and is correlated with behaviour. Yet its role in the processing of external information and its relationship to internal representations of sensory attributes remains unknown. Using voltage sensitive dye imaging, we previously established a close link between ongoing activity in the visual cortex of anaesthetized cats and the spontaneous firing of a single neuron. Here we report that such activity encompasses a set of dynamically switching cortical states, many of which correspond closely to orientation maps. When such an orientation state emerged spontaneously, it spanned several hypercolumns and was often followed by a state corresponding to a proximal orientation. We suggest that dynamically switching cortical states could represent the brain's internal context, and therefore reflect or influence memory, perception and behaviour.},

Excitatory neurons had sharp response selectivity for stimulus orientation and spatial frequency, while all GABAergic subtypes had broader selectivity. Further, bias in the responses of GABAergic neurons toward particular orientations or spatial frequencies tended to reflect net biases of the surrounding neurons. These results suggest that the sensory responses of layer 2/3 GABAergic neurons reflect the pooled activity of the surrounding population--a principle that may generalize across species and sensory modalities.},

abstract = {Responses of a visual neuron to optimally oriented stimuli can be suppressed by a superposition of another grating with a different orientation. This effect is known as cross-orientation suppression. However, it is still not clear whether the effect is intracortical in origin or a reflection of subcortical processes. To address this issue, we measured spatiotemporal responses to a plaid pattern, a superposition of two gratings, as well as to individual component gratings (optimal and mask) using a subspace reverse-correlation method. Suppression for the plaid was evaluated by comparing the response to that for the optimal grating. For component stimuli, excitatory and negative responses were defined as responses more positive and negative, respectively, than that to a blank stimulus. The suppressive effect for plaids was observed in the vast majority of neurons. However, only approximately 30\% of neurons showed the negative response to mask-only gratings. The magnitudes of negative responses to mask-only stimuli were correlated with the degree of suppression for plaid stimuli. Comparing the latencies, we found that the suppression for the plaids starts at about the same time or slightly later than the response onset for the optimal grating and reaches its maximum at about the same time as the peak latency for the mask-only grating. Based on these results, we propose that in addition to the suppressive effect originating at the subcortical stage, delayed suppressive signals derived from the intracortical networks act on the neuron to generate cross-orientation suppression.},

abstract = {Studies of visual development show that basic metrics of visual development such as spatial resolution develop over the first 6-9 months in monkeys and over the first 6 or so years in humans. However, more complex visual functions may develop over different, or more protracted, time courses. To address the question of whether global perceptual processing is linked to or otherwise dependent on the development of basic spatial vision, we studied the development of contour integration, a global perceptual task, in comparison to that of grating acuity in macaque monkeys. We find that contour integration develops substantially later than acuity. Contour integration begins to develop at 5-6 months, near the time that acuity development is complete and continues to mature well into the second postnatal year. We discuss this later development in terms poor central efficiency and consider the relevant anatomy and physiology of the developing visual system. We conclude that contour integration is not likely to be limited by the same mechanisms that are permissive to acuity development, and may instead reflect the emergence of function central to V1.},

abstract = {Anatomical and immunohistochemical data indicate that, in addition to pyramidal neurons, nonpyramidal cells are exposed to perisomatic inhibition mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-containing terminals. However, no direct information is available as yet for the origin of GABAergic inputs to morphologically identified GABAergic neurons. In the present paper, we studied the topographical and synaptic relationship between identified GABAergic large basket cells and their immunohistochemically characterized target neurons revealed by parvalbumin-(PV) and GABA immunostaining in the same material. Extracellularly applied biocytin labelled a total of 36 and 9 large basket cells in layers III and V, respectively. Of these, the axonal arborizations of two basket cells, BC1 and BC2, were reconstructed. The axon of BC1 occupied an area of about 2.3 x 2.2 mm2 in layer III, providing a total of 2,755 terminals. The axon of BC2 showed an overall extent of 3.8 x 1.7 mm2 in layer V elongated in the anteroposterior direction, and gave off 1,599 terminals. Immunostaining for PV was carried out to reveal putative nonpyramidal targets for BC1 and BC2. It was found that in addition to immunonegative cells, they established an average of 4-6 perisomatic contacts onto each of 58 (BC1) and 33 (BC2) PV-immunopositive neurons. For electron microscopic verification, 23 terminals apposing the somata of 12 PV-immunopositive neurons were selected. Each terminal was found to establish symmetrical (type II) contacts with its targeted cell. Furthermore, the distribution of soma area of the targeted PV-immunopositive cells and of identified large basket cells showed remarkable similarity, implying that the two populations were actually the same. In addition, the average horizontal distance between neighbouring PV-immunopositive target cells was found to be about 100 microns both in layers III and V. The results suggest that in area 18 the same large basket cell provides direct inhibition to certain pyramidal cells and facilitation to other pyramidal neurons, by inhibiting their presynaptic large basket cells at regular intervals.},

abstract = {The topography of lateral excitatory and lateral inhibitory connections was studied in relation to orientation maps obtained in areas 17 and 18. Small iontophoretic injections of biocytin were delivered to the superficial layers in regions where orientation selectivity had been mapped using electrode recordings of single- and multi-unit activity from various cortical depths. Biocytin revealed extensive patchy axonal projections of up to 3.5 mm in both areas while labelled somata occurred chiefly at the injection site, indicating that the labelling was primarily anterograde. Two types of boutons could be clearly distinguished: (i) putative excitatory boutons either en passant or having a short stalk and (ii) inhibitory boutons which were invariably of the basket-type. Three-dimensional reconstructions of all labelled boutons showed that the excitatory and the inhibitory networks had a distinctively different relationship to orientation maps. The overall distribution of connections showed that 53-59\% of excitatory and 46-48\% of inhibitory connections were at iso-orientation, +/-30 degrees; oblique-orientation, +/-(30-60) degrees, was shown by 30\% of excitatory and 28-39\% of inhibitory connections; cross-orientation was shown by 11-17\% of excitatory and 15-24\% of inhibitory connections. Although excitatory patches occupied mainly iso-orientation locations, interpatch regions representing chiefly non-iso-orientations (oblique + cross orientation) were also innervated. There was considerable overlap between the excitatory and inhibitory network. Nonetheless, inhibitory connections were more common than excitatory connections with non-iso-orientation locations. There was no significant difference between the orientation topography of area 17 and area 18 projections. The results suggest that in general the lateral connectivity system is not orientation specific, but shows a moderate iso-orientation preference for excitation and an even weaker iso-orientation preference for inhibition. The broad orientation spectrum of lateral connections could provide the basis for mechanisms that requiring different orientations, as for example in detecting orientation discontinuities.},

abstract = {Networks of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing basket cells are implicated in synchronizing cortical neurons at various frequencies, through GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic action. These cells are interconnected by GABAergic synapses and gap junctions, and converge with a different class of cholecystokinin-expressing, PV-negative basket cells onto pyramidal cells. To define the molecular specializations in the synapses of the two basket cell populations, we used quantitative electron microscopic immunogold localization of GABA(A) receptors. Synapses formed by PV-positive basket cells on the somata of pyramidal cells had several-fold higher density of alpha1 subunit-containing receptors than synapses made by PV-negative basket cells, most of which were immunonegative. The density of the beta2/3 subunits was similar in the two populations of synapse, indicating similar overall receptor density. Synapses interconnecting parvalbumin-expressing basket cells contained a 3.6 times higher overall density of GABA(A) receptor (beta2/3 subunits) and 3.2 times higher density of alpha1 subunit labeling compared with synapses formed by boutons of PV-positive basket cells on pyramidal cells. Thus, PV-positive basket cells mainly act through alpha1 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors, but the receptor density depends on the postsynaptic cell type. These observations, together with previously reported enrichment of the alpha2 subunit-containing receptors in synapses made by PV-negative basket cells, indicate that the number and subtypes of GABA(A) receptors present in different synapse populations are regulated by both presynaptic and postsynaptic influences. The high number of GABA(A) receptors in synapses on basket cells might contribute to the precisely timed phasing of basket cell activity.},

Four processes are fundamental to attention: working memory, top-down sensitivity control, competitive selection, and automatic bottom-up filtering for salient stimuli. Each process makes a distinct and essential contribution to attention. Voluntary control of attention involves the first three processes (working memory, top-down sensitivity control, and competitive selection) operating in a recurrent loop.

abstract = {Sensory processing occurs in neocortical microcircuits in which synaptic connectivity is highly structured and excitatory neurons form subnetworks that process related sensory information. However, the developmental mechanisms underlying the formation of functionally organized connectivity in cortical microcircuits remain unknown. Here we directly relate patterns of excitatory synaptic connectivity to visual response properties of neighbouring layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in mouse visual cortex at different postnatal ages, using two-photon calcium imaging in vivo and multiple whole-cell recordings in vitro. Although neural responses were already highly selective for visual stimuli at eye opening, neurons responding to similar visual features were not yet preferentially connected, indicating that the emergence of feature selectivity does not depend on the precise arrangement of local synaptic connections. After eye opening, local connectivity reorganized extensively: more connections formed selectively between neurons with similar visual responses and connections were eliminated between visually unresponsive neurons, but the overall connectivity rate did not change. We propose a sequential model of cortical microcircuit development based on activity-dependent mechanisms of plasticity whereby neurons first acquire feature preference by selecting feedforward inputs before the onset of sensory experience--a process that may be facilitated by early electrical coupling between neuronal subsets--and then patterned input drives the formation of functional subnetworks through a redistribution of recurrent synaptic connections.},

Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of sensory processing requires uncovering how connection patterns between neurons relate to their function. On a coarse scale, long-range projections can preferentially link cortical regions with similar responses to sensory stimuli. But on the local scale, where dendrites and axons overlap substantially, the functional specificity of connections remains unknown. Here we determine synaptic connectivity between nearby layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in vitro, the response properties of which were first characterized in mouse visual cortex in vivo. We found that connection probability was related to the similarity of visually driven neuronal activity. Neurons with the same preference for oriented stimuli connected at twice the rate of neurons with orthogonal orientation preferences. Neurons responding similarly to naturalistic stimuli formed connections at much higher rates than those with uncorrelated responses. Bidirectional synaptic connections were found more frequently between neuronal pairs with strongly correlated visual responses. Our results reveal the degree of functional specificity of local synaptic connections in the visual cortex, and point to the existence of fine-scale subnetworks dedicated to processing related sensory information.},

abstract = {Acetylcholine (ACh) reduces the spatial spread of excitatory fMRI responses in early visual cortex and receptive field size of V1 neurons. We investigated the perceptual consequences of these physiological effects of ACh with surround suppression and crowding, two phenomena that involve spatial interactions between visual field locations. Surround suppression refers to the reduction in perceived stimulus contrast by a high-contrast surround stimulus. For grating stimuli, surround suppression is selective for the relative orientations of the center and surround, suggesting that it results from inhibitory interactions in early visual cortex. Crowding refers to impaired identification of a peripheral stimulus in the presence of flankers and is thought to result from excessive integration of visual features. We increased synaptic ACh levels by administering the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil to healthy human subjects in a placebo-controlled, double-blind design. In Experiment 1, we measured surround suppression of a central grating using a contrast discrimination task with three conditions: (1) surround grating with the same orientation as the center (parallel), (2) surround orthogonal to the center, or (3) no surround. Contrast discrimination thresholds were higher in the parallel than in the orthogonal condition, demonstrating orientation-specific surround suppression (OSSS). Cholinergic enhancement decreased thresholds only in the parallel condition, thereby reducing OSSS. In Experiment 2, subjects performed a crowding task in which they reported the identity of a peripheral letter flanked by letters on either side. We measured the critical spacing between the targets and flanking letters that allowed reliable identification. Cholinergic enhancement with donepezil had no effect on critical spacing. Our findings suggest that ACh reduces spatial interactions in tasks involving segmentation of visual field locations but that these effects may be limited to early visual cortical processing.},

abstract = {A fundamental feature of the mammalian visual system is the presence of separate channels that work in parallel to efficiently extract and analyze specific elements of a visual scene. Despite the extensive use of the mouse as a model system, it is not clear whether such parallel organization extends beyond the retina to subcortical structures, such as the dorsal lateral geniculate (dLGN) of thalamus. To begin to address this, we examined the morphology of biocytin-filled relay cells recorded in dLGN of mice. Based on a quantitative assessment of their dendritic architecture, we found that even at early postnatal ages relay cells could be readily classified as X-like (biconical), Y-like (symmetrical), or W-like (hemispheric) and that each cell type was regionally specified in dLGN. X-like cells were confined primarily to the monocular ventral region of dLGN. Y-like cells occupied a central core that also contained ipsilateral eye projections, whereas W-like cells were found along the perimeter of dLGN. Similar to cat, Y-like cells were more prevalent than X- and W-like cells, and X-like cells tended to be smaller than other cell types. However, the dendritic fields of X- and W-like cells did not exhibit an orientation bias with respect to optic tract or boundaries of dLGN. Although we found clear morphological differences among relay cells, an analysis of their electrophysiological properties did not reveal any additional distinguishing characteristics. Overall, these data coupled with recent observations in the retina suggest that the mouse has many of the hallmark features of a system-wide parallel organization.},

abstract = {Local GABAergic connections are undoubtedly important for the operation of cerebral cortex, including the tuning of receptive field properties of visual cortical neurons. In order to begin to correlate specific configurations of GABAergic networks with particular receptive field properties, we examined the arrangement of GABAergic neurons projecting to foci in compartments of known functional specialization in striate (area V1) and extrastriate (areas V2, V4) cortices of rhesus monkeys. GABAergic cells were detected autoradiographically following microinjections into supragranular, granular, or infragranular layers of 5, 10, or 50 nl of 3H-nipecotic acid, which selectively exploits the GABA reuptake mechanism. These injections produced complex inter- and intralaminar distributions of retrograde perikaryal labeling that was selective for GABA-immunopositive neurons and glia. The pattern of retrograde labeling depended on both the laminar and cytoarchitectonic location of injection sites. In all cases, a high density of labeled neurons was present in the immediate vicinity of injection sites, with the density of labeled neurons decreasing for the most part uniformly with horizontal distance. Injections in supragranular layers produced relatively widespread labeling (up to 1.5-1.7 mm from the center of injections) in upper layers, whereas in granular and infragranular layers, labeling was confined to a radius of 0.25-0.5 mm. Conversely, injections in infragranular layers produced labeling that was widest (up to 1 mm) in lower layers, but more laterally restricted in supragranular layers. Injections in granular layers, on the other hand, produced an even distribution of labeling, 0.6-1.0 mm in diameter, throughout all layers. Comparably placed injections in V1, V2, and V4 resulted in patterns of labeling that were distinguished by features including stepwise increases in the lateral extent of labeling from striate to extrastriate areas, and the circular versus markedly elongated intralaminar distribution of labeled neurons in V1 and V4 versus V2. Further, for superficial injections, labeling was present in all layers in V1 and V2, but did not extent below the top layer V in area V4. These findings offer clear examples of organizational differences in the intrinsic inhibitory connections of visual cortices. The results also demonstrate that the number of GABAergic neurons projecting to any spot in cortex decreases systematically with horizontal distance from the spot, and that radiolabeled cells do not coalesce to form slabs, columns, or clusters. This relatively even distribution of retrogradely labeled cells in the tangential plane is consistent with recent computer simulations (Worgotter and Koch, 1991) that suggest that inhibitory neurons broadly tuned as a population can produce the specific response properties of cortical neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Neuromodulators such as acetylcholine, serotonin, and noradrenaline are powerful regulators of neocortical activity. Although it is well established that cortical inhibition is the target of these modulations, little is known about their effects on GABA release from specific interneuron types. This knowledge is necessary to gain a mechanistic understanding of the actions of neuromodulators because different interneuron classes control specific aspects of excitatory cell function. Here, we report that GABA release from fast-spiking (FS) cells, the most prevalent interneuron subtype in neocortex, is robustly inhibited following activation of muscarinic, serotonin, adenosine, and GABA(B) receptors--an effect that regulates FS cell control of excitatory neuron firing. The potent muscarinic inhibition of GABA release from FS cells suppresses thalamocortical feedforward inhibition. This is supplemented by the muscarinic-mediated depolarization of thalamo-recipient excitatory neurons and the nicotinic enhancement of thalamic input onto these neurons to promote thalamocortical excitation.},

Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) could, in principle, provide a source of photoreceptors to repair the retina. We have previously shown that retinal progenitors can be efficiently derived from human ESCs. We now show that retinal cells derived from human ESCs will migrate into mouse retinas following intraocular injection, settle into the appropriate layers, and express markers for differentiated cells, including both rod and cone photoreceptor cells. After transplantation of the cells into the subretinal space of adult Crx(-/-) mice (a model of Leber's Congenital Amaurosis), the hESC-derived retinal cells differentiate into functional photoreceptors and restore light responses to the animals. These results demonstrate that hESCs can, in principle, be used for photoreceptor replacement therapies.},

Horizontal connections within areas, and higher areas providing feedback, result in dynamic changes in tuning. The differences between feedforward and recurrent processing could prove pivotal in understanding the distinctions between attentive and pre-attentive vision as well as between conscious and unconscious vision. The feedforward sweep rapidly groups feature constellations that are hardwired in the visual brain, yet is probably incapable of yielding visual awareness; in many cases, recurrent processing is necessary before the features of an object are attentively grouped and the stimulus can enter consciousness.},

However, in some neurons, LTP depends instead on calcium-permeable AMPA-type receptors. This is paradoxical because intracellular polyamines block such receptors during depolarization. We report that LTP at synapses on hippocampal interneurons mediating feedback inhibition is "anti-Hebbian":Itis induced by presynaptic activity but prevented by postsynaptic depolarization. Anti-Hebbian LTP may occur in interneurons that are silent during periods of intense pyramidal cell firing, such as sharp waves, and lead to their altered activation during theta activity.},

The random initial connections in the networks consistently converged to regular patterns. Analyses of these connection patterns showed that the response of each complex cell to the random-bar stimuli could be well approximated by the sum of a small number of subunits resembling simple cells. The direction selectivity of each complex cell measured with drifting gratings was also well predicted by the combination of these subunits, indicating the generality of the model. These results are consistent with a simple functional model for complex cells and demonstrate the usefulness of the neural network method for revealing the stimulus-response transformations of nonlinear neurons.},

This hypothesis was tested in 3 studies; all used a variation of the response competition paradigm to measure irrelevant processing when load in the relevant processing was varied. Perceptual load was manipulated by relevant display set size or by different processing requirements for identical displays. These included the requirement to process conjunctions versus isolated features and the requirement to perform simple detection of a character's presence versus difficult identification of its size and position. Distractors' interference was found only under low-load conditions. Because the distractor was usually clearly distinct from the target, it is concluded that physical separation is not a sufficient condition for selective perception; overloading perception is also required. This allows a compromise between early and late selection views and resolves apparent discrepancies in previous work.},

How can these three properties be reconciled? Using a mechanistic model of the development of neural connectivity in V1, we show how including two low-level mechanisms originally motivated from single-neuron results makes development stable, robust, and adaptive. Specifically, contrast gain control in the retinal ganglion cells and the LGN reduces variation in the presynaptic drive due to differences in input patterns, while homeostatic plasticity of V1 neuron excitability reduces the postsynaptic variability in firing rates. Together these two mechanisms lead to maps that develop stably and robustly, yet adapt to the visual environment. The modelling results suggest that topographic map stability is a natural outcome of low-level processes of adaptation and normalization. The resulting model is also a more robust yet simpler and more realistic model of map development than previous models, and is thus a good starting point for future studies of cortical map development.},

In this review, we provide an overview of the maturation of GABAergic neurotransmission and discuss the role of GABAergic interneurons in cortical wiring, plasticity, and network activity during pre- and postnatal development.

abstract = {Hippocampal parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV INs) provide fast and reliable GABAergic signalling to principal cells and orchestrate hippocampal ensemble activities. Precise coordination of principal cell activity by PV INs relies in part on the efficacy of excitatory afferents that recruit them in the hippocampal network. Feed-forward (FF) inputs in particular from Schaffer collaterals influence spike timing precision in CA1 principal cells whereas local feedback (FB) inputs may contribute to pacemaker activities. Although PV INs have been shown to undergo activity-dependent long term plasticity, how both inputs are modulated during principal cell firing is unknown. Here we show that FF and FB synapses onto PV INs are endowed with distinct postsynaptic glutamate receptors which set opposing long-term plasticity rules. Inward-rectifying AMPA receptors (AMPARs) expressed at both FF and FB inputs mediate a form of anti-Hebbian long term potentiation (LTP), relying on coincident membrane hyperpolarization and synaptic activation. In contrast, FF inputs are largely devoid of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) which are more abundant at FB afferents and confer on them an additional form of LTP with Hebbian properties. Both forms of LTP are expressed with no apparent change in presynaptic function. The specific endowment of FF and FB inputs with distinct coincidence detectors allow them to be differentially tuned upon high frequency afferent activity. Thus, high frequency (>20 Hz) stimulation specifically potentiates FB, but not FF afferents. We propose that these differential, input-specific learning rules may allow PV INs to adapt to changes in hippocampal activity while preserving their precisely timed, clockwork operation.},

abstract = {Although many studies have shown that attention to a stimulus can enhance the responses of individual cortical sensory neurons, little is known about how attention accomplishes this change in response. Here, we propose that attention-based changes in neuronal responses depend on the same response normalization mechanism that adjusts sensory responses whenever multiple stimuli are present. We have implemented a model of attention that assumes that attention works only through this normalization mechanism, and show that it can replicate key effects of attention. The model successfully explains how attention changes the gain of responses to individual stimuli and also why modulation by attention is more robust and not a simple gain change when multiple stimuli are present inside a neuron's receptive field. Additionally, the model accounts well for physiological data that measure separately attentional modulation and sensory normalization of the responses of individual neurons in area MT in visual cortex. The proposal that attention works through a normalization mechanism sheds new light a broad range of observations on how attention alters the representation of sensory information in cerebral cortex.},

abstract = {The influence of motor activity on sensory processing is crucial for perception and motor execution. However, the underlying circuits are not known. To unravel the circuit by which activity in the primary vibrissal motor cortex (vM1) modulates sensory processing in the primary somatosensory barrel cortex (S1), we used optogenetics to examine the long-range inputs from vM1 to the various neuronal elements in S1. We found that S1-projecting vM1 pyramidal neurons strongly recruited vasointestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing GABAergic interneurons, a subset of serotonin receptor-expressing interneurons. These VIP interneurons preferentially inhibited somatostatin-expressing interneurons, neurons that target the distal dendrites of pyramidal cells. Consistent with this vM1-mediated disinhibitory circuit, the activity of VIP interneurons in vivo increased and that of somatostatin interneurons decreased during whisking. These changes in firing rates during whisking depended on vM1 activity. Our results suggest previously unknown circuitry by which inputs from motor cortex influence sensory processing in sensory cortex.},

abstract = {Sensory microcircuits are refined by experience during windows of heightened plasticity termed "critical periods" (CPs). In visual cortex the effects of visual deprivation change dramatically at the transition from the pre-CP to the CP, but the cellular plasticity mechanisms that underlie this change are poorly understood. Here we show that plasticity at unitary connections between GABAergic Fast Spiking (FS) cells and Star Pyramidal (SP) neurons within layer 4 flips sign at the transition between the pre-CP and the CP. During the pre-CP, coupling FS firing with SP depolarization induces long-term depression of inhibition at this synapse, whereas the same protocol induces long-term potentiation of inhibition at the opening of the CP. Despite being of opposite sign, both forms of plasticity share expression characteristics-a change in coefficient of variation with no change in paired-pulse ratio-and depend on GABAB receptor signaling. Finally, we show that the reciprocal SP→FS synapse also acquires the ability to undergo long-term potentiation at the pre-CP to CP transition. Thus, at the opening of the CP, there are coordinated changes in plasticity that allow specific patterns of activity within layer 4 to potentiate feedback inhibition by boosting the strength of FS↔SP connections.},

abstract = {Learning causes a change in how information is processed by neuronal circuits. Whereas synaptic plasticity, an important cellular mechanism, has been studied in great detail, we know much less about how learning is implemented at the level of neuronal circuits and, in particular, how interactions between distinct types of neurons within local networks contribute to the process of learning. Here we show that acquisition of associative fear memories depends on the recruitment of a disinhibitory microcircuit in the mouse auditory cortex. Fear-conditioning-associated disinhibition in auditory cortex is driven by foot-shock-mediated cholinergic activation of layer 1 interneurons, in turn generating inhibition of layer 2/3 parvalbumin-positive interneurons. Importantly, pharmacological or optogenetic block of pyramidal neuron disinhibition abolishes fear learning. Together, these data demonstrate that stimulus convergence in the auditory cortex is necessary for associative fear learning to complex tones, define the circuit elements mediating this convergence and suggest that layer-1-mediated disinhibition is an important mechanism underlying learning and information processing in neocortical circuits.},

@article{Levitt2001,
abstract = {It is now well appreciated that parallel retino-geniculo-cortical pathways exist in the monkey as in the cat, the species in which parallel visual pathways were first and most thoroughly documented. What remains unclear is precisely how many separate pathways pass through the parvo- and magnocellular divisions of the macaque lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), what relationships-homologous or otherwise-these pathways have to the cat's X, Y, and W pathways, and whether these are affected by visual deprivation. To address these issues of classification and trans-species comparison, we used achromatic stimuli to obtain an extensive set of quantitative measurements of receptive field properties in the parvo- and magnocellular laminae of the LGN of nine macaque monkeys: four normally reared and five monocularly deprived of vision by lid suture near the time of birth. In agreement with previous studies, we find that on average magnocellular neurons differ from parvocellular neurons by having shorter response latencies to optic chiasm stimulation, greater sensitivity to luminance contrast, and better temporal resolution. Magnocellular laminae are also distinguished by containing neurons that summate luminance over their receptive fields nonlinearly (Y cells) and whose temporal response phases decrease with increasing stimulus contrast (indicative of a contrast gain control mechanism). We found little evidence for major differences between magno- and parvocellular neurons on the basis of most spatial parameters except that at any eccentricity, the neurons with the smallest receptive field centers tended to be parvocellular. All parameters were distributed unimodally and continuously through the parvo- and magnocellular populations, giving no indications of subpopulations within each division. Monocular deprivation led to clear anatomical effects: cells in deprived-eye laminae were pale and shrunken compared with those in nondeprived eye laminae, and Cat-301 immunoreactivity in deprived laminae was essentially uniformly abolished. However, deprivation had only subtle effects on the response properties of LGN neurons. Neurons driven by the deprived eye in both magno- and parvocellular laminae had lower nonlinearity indices (i.e., summed signals across their receptive fields more linearly) and were somewhat less responsive. In magnocellular laminae driven by the deprived eye, neuronal response latencies to stimulation of the optic chiasm were slightly shorter than those in the nondeprived laminae, and receptive field surrounds were a bit stronger. No other response parameters were affected by deprivation, and there was no evidence for loss of a specific cell class as in the cat.},

abstract = {We recorded activity of single units in macaque monkey primary visual cortex (V1) to define the retinotopic extent of the visual inputs that drive or modulate V1 neuron responses in parafoveal and peripheral (calcarine) cortex. We used high-contrast drifting grating stimuli to define the extent of the area over which responses summate and the extent of the receptive-field surround. We found responses of most V1 cells to summate over 1 deg, with a suppressive surround typically twice that in diameter, though for some cells (even in parafoveal V1) surrounds exceeded 13 deg in diameter. Surprisingly, we found no significant laminar differences in these dimensions or in the strength of surround suppression. We found that surround suppression in most cells arises from both the ends and sides of the receptive field. Our measures indicate that the strongest modulatory input arises from regions immediately adjacent to the excitatory summation area. These physiological measures suggest that the high-contrast summation field of V1 neurons can be accounted for by the sum of lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) inputs offered to the local cortical column, with monosynaptic lateral connections within area V1 adding the larger dimensions of the low-contrast summation field and the near surround. Neither of these inputs suffice to explain the largest surrounds, which most likely derive from feedback from extrastriate visual areas.},

abstract = {Acetylcholine (ACh) influences attention, short-term memory, and sleep/waking transitions, through its modulatory influence on cortical neurons. It has been proposed that behavioral state changes mediated by ACh result from its selective effects on the intrinsic membrane properties of diverse cortical inhibitory interneuron classes. ACh has been widely shown to reduce the strength of excitatory (glutamatergic) synapses. But past studies using extracellular stimulation have not been able to examine the effects of ACh on local cortical connections important for shaping sensory processing. Here, using dual intracellular recording in slices of rat somatosensory cortex, we show that reduction of local excitatory input to inhibitory neurons by ACh is coupled to differences in the underlying short-term synaptic plasticity (STP). In synapses with short-term depression, where successive evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs; >5 Hz) usually diminish in strength (short-term depression), cholinergic agonist (5-10 microM carbachol (CCh)) reduced the amplitude of the first EPSP in an evoked train, but CCh's net effect on subsequent EPSPs rapidly diminished. In synapses where successive EPSPs increased in strength (facilitation), the effect of CCh on later EPSPs in an evoked train became progressively greater. The effect of CCh on both depressing and facilitating synapses was blocked by the muscarinic antagonist, 1-5 microM atropine. It is suggested that selective influence on STP contributes fundamentally to cholinergic "switching" between cortical rhythms that underlie different behavioral states.},

abstract = {We studied the cholinergic modulation of glutamatergic transmission between neighboring layer 5 regular-spiking pyramidal neurons in somatosensory cortical slices from young rats (P10-P26). Brief bath application of 5-10 microM carbachol, a nonspecific cholinergic agonist, decreased the amplitude of evoked unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). This effect was blocked by 1 microM atropine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist. Nicotine (10 microM), in contrast to carbachol, reduced EPSPs in nominally magnesium-free solution but not in the presence of 1 mM Mg+2, indicating the involvement of NMDA receptors. Likewise, when the postsynaptic cell was depolarized under voltage clamp to allow NMDA receptor activation in the presence of 1 mM Mg+2, synaptic currents were reduced by nicotine. Nicotinic EPSP reduction was prevented by the NMDA receptor antagonist D-AP5 (50 microM) and by the nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine (10 microM). Both carbachol and nicotine reduced short-term depression of EPSPs evoked by 10 Hz stimulation, indicating that EPSP reduction happens via reduction of presynaptic glutamate release. In the case of nicotine, several possible mechanisms for NMDAR-dependent EPSP reduction are discussed. As a result of NMDA receptor dependence, nicotinic EPSP reduction may serve to reduce the local spread of cortical excitation during heightened sensory activity.},

abstract = {Lateral spatial interactions among elements of a scene, which either enhance or degrade visual performance, are ubiquitous in vision. The neural mechanisms underlying lateral spatial interactions are a matter of debate, and various hypotheses have been proposed. Suppressive effects may be due to local inhibitory interactions, whereas facilitatory effects are typically ascribed either to the function of long-range horizontal projections in V1 or to uncertainty reduction. We investigated the development of lateral spatial interactions, facilitation and suppression, and compared their developmental profiles to those of potential underlying mechanisms in the visual system of infant macaques. Animals ranging in age from 10 weeks to 3 years were tested with a lateral masking paradigm. We found that suppressive interactions are present from very early in postnatal life, showing no change over the age range tested. However, facilitation develops slowly over the first year after birth. Our data suggest that the early maturation of suppressive interactions is related to the relatively mature receptive field properties of neurons in early visual cortical areas near birth in infant macaques, whereas the later maturation of facilitation is unlikely to be explained by development of local or long-range connectivity in primary visual cortex. Instead our data favor a late developing feedback or top-down cognitive process to explain the origin of facilitation.},

In auditory cortex, however, functional properties of genetically identified inhibitory neurons are poorly characterized. By two-photon imaging-guided recordings, we specifically targeted 2 major types of cortical inhibitory neuron, parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) expressing neurons, in superficial layers of mouse auditory cortex. We found that PV cells exhibited broader tonal receptive fields with lower intensity thresholds and stronger tone-evoked spike responses compared with SOM neurons. The latter exhibited similar frequency selectivity as excitatory neurons. The broader/weaker frequency tuning of PV neurons was attributed to a broader range of synaptic inputs and stronger subthreshold responses elicited, which resulted in a higher efficiency in the conversion of input to output. In addition, onsets of both the input and spike responses of SOM neurons were significantly delayed compared with PV and excitatory cells. Our results suggest that PV and SOM neurons engage in auditory cortical circuits in different manners: while PV neurons may provide broadly tuned feedforward inhibition for a rapid control of ascending inputs to excitatory neurons, the delayed and more selective inhibition from SOM neurons may provide a specific modulation of feedback inputs on their distal dendrites.},

abstract = {Development of the selective response properties that define columns in sensory cortex is thought to begin early in cortical maturation, without the need for experience. We investigated the development of direction selectivity in ferret visual cortex using optical imaging and electrophysiological techniques and found an exception to this view. Unlike orientation selectivity and ocular dominance, direction selectivity was not detected at eye opening. Direction selectivity emerged several days later and strengthened to adult levels over the following 2 weeks. Visual experience was essential for this process, as shown by the absence of direction selectivity in dark-reared ferrets. The impairment persisted in dark-reared ferrets that were given experience after this period, despite the recovery of response amplitude, preference and bandwidth for stimulus orientation, spatial and temporal frequency, and contrast. Visual experience in early postnatal life plays a necessary and unique role in the development of cortical direction selectivity.},

abstract = {The onset of vision occurs when neural circuits in the visual cortex are immature, lacking both the full complement of connections and the response selectivity that defines functional maturity. Direction-selective responses are particularly vulnerable to the effects of early visual deprivation, but it remains unclear how stimulus-driven neural activity guides the emergence of cortical direction selectivity. Here we report observations from a motion training protocol that allowed us to monitor the impact of experience on the development of direction-selective responses in visually naive ferrets. Using intrinsic signal imaging techniques, we found that training with a single axis of motion induced the rapid emergence of direction columns that were confined to cortical regions preferentially activated by the training stimulus. Using two-photon calcium imaging techniques, we found that single neurons in visually naive animals exhibited weak directional biases and lacked the strong local coherence in the spatial organization of direction preference that was evident in mature animals. Training with a moving stimulus, but not with a flashed stimulus, strengthened the direction-selective responses of individual neurons and preferentially reversed the direction biases of neurons that deviated from their neighbours. Both effects contributed to an increase in local coherence. We conclude that early experience with moving visual stimuli drives the rapid emergence of direction-selective responses in the visual cortex.},

abstract = {Orientation selectivity (OS) is an emergent property in the primary visual cortex (V1). How OS arises from synaptic circuits remains unsolved. Here, in vivo whole-cell recordings in the mouse V1 revealed that simple cells received broadly tuned excitation and even more broadly tuned inhibition. Excitation and inhibition shared a similar orientation preference and temporally overlapped substantially. Neuron modeling and dynamic-clamp recording further revealed that excitatory inputs alone would result in membrane potential responses with significantly attenuated selectivity, due to a saturating input-output function of the membrane filtering. Inhibition ameliorated the attenuation of excitatory selectivity by expanding the input dynamic range and caused additional sharpening of output responses beyond unselectively suppressing responses at all orientations. This " blur-sharpening" effect allows selectivity conveyed by excitatory inputs to be better expressed, which may be a general mechanism underlying the generation of feature-selective responses in the face of strong excitatory inputs that are weakly biased. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Synaptic inhibition plays an important role in shaping receptive field (RF) properties in the visual cortex. However, the underlying mechanisms remain not well understood, partly because of difficulties in systematically studying functional properties of cortical inhibitory neurons in vivo. Here, we established two-photon imaging guided cell-attached recordings from genetically labeled inhibitory neurons and nearby "shadowed" excitatory neurons in the primary visual cortex of adult mice. Our results revealed that in layer 2/3, the majority of excitatory neurons exhibited both On and Off spike subfields, with their spatial arrangement varying from being completely segregated to overlapped. In contrast, most layer 4 excitatory neurons exhibited only one discernable subfield. Interestingly, no RF structure with significantly segregated On and Off subfields was observed for layer 2/3 inhibitory neurons of either the fast-spike or regular-spike type. They predominantly possessed overlapped On and Off subfields with a significantly larger size than the excitatory neurons and exhibited much weaker orientation tuning. These results from the mouse visual cortex suggest that different from the push-pull model proposed for simple cells, layer 2/3 simple-type neurons with segregated spike On and Off subfields likely receive spatially overlapped inhibitory On and Off inputs. We propose that the phase-insensitive inhibition can enhance the spatial distinctiveness of On and Off subfields through a gain control mechanism.},

abstract = {Primates base perceptual judgments on some sensory inputs while ignoring others. The covert selection of sensory information for perception is often thought to be accomplished mostly by the cerebral cortex, whereas the overt orienting toward relevant stimuli involves various additional structures such as the superior colliculus, a subcortical region involved in the control of eye movements. Contrary to this view, we show that the superior colliculus is necessary for determining which stimuli will inform perceptual judgments, even in the absence of orienting movements. Reversible inactivation of the superior colliculus in monkeys performing a motion discrimination task caused profound inattention for stimuli in the affected visual field, but only when distracters containing counterinformative signals appeared in the unaffected field. When distracting stimuli contained no information, discrimination performance was largely unaffected. Thus, the superior colliculus is a bottleneck in the covert selection of signals for perceptual judgments.},

abstract = {Acetylcholine (ACh) is an important neurotransmitter of the CNS that binds both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors to exert its action. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of cholinergic receptors have still not been completely elucidated. Central cholinergic neurons, mainly located in basal forebrain, send their projections to different structures including the cortex. The cortical innervation is diffuse and roughly topographic, which has prompted some authors to suspect a modulating role of ACh on the activity of the cortical network rather than a direct synaptic role. The cholinergic system is implicated in functional, behavioural and pathological states including cognitive function, nicotine addiction, Alzheimer's disease, Tourette's syndrome, epilepsies and schizophrenia. As these processes depend on the activation of glutamatergic and GABAergic systems, the cholinergic terminals must exert their effects via the modulation of excitatory and/or inhibitory neurotransmission. However, the understanding of cholinergic modulation is complex because it is the result of a mixture of positive and negative modulation, implying that there are various types, or even subtypes, of cholinergic receptors. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on central cholinergic systems (projections and receptors) and then aim to focus on the implications for ACh in the modulation of cortical neuronal activity.},

These layers receive intrinsic interlaminar excitatory and inhibitory relays from layers 3B, 4A, 4B, and 5. We describe seven varieties of local circuit neurons with somata within layers 1-2/3A, and we compare the lateral scale of spread of the axons and dendrites of these neurons with the size of the columnar connectional patch domains made by the laterally spreading axon collaterals of pyramidal neurons within the superficial layers (Lund et al. [1993] Cerebral Cortex 3:148-162). We conclude from this comparison that all of the neurons have dendritic fields that are limited to single patch domains. Furthermore, only two of the seven local circuit neuron varieties have sufficient axon spread to influence territory beyond single domains, reaching into neighboring territory likely to differ in function from that occupied by their dendrites. We have identified descending projections from particular varieties to layers 3B, 4A, 4B, and 5 and to the white matter. We discuss the contributions that these interneurons may make to function within the superficial cortical layers, and we summarize our overall conclusions, so far, from our set of studies on interneurons within area V1 of the macaque.},

The 3 models use, respectively, a fully implemented computer neural network, a mathematical formulation of interactions in a descriptive model of anatomical circuitry and a purely descriptive account of circuitry that could underlie particular functions. The 1st 2 models involve as part of their design an interpolation principle where afferents of opposite physiological property establish spatially offset but adjacent terminal fields and the postsynaptic neurons' dendrites have a continuum of different degrees of overlap into the 2 afferent pools and therefore different synaptic weights from the 2 afferents; this creates a functional and spatial gradient of response properties in the postsynaptic neurons between the properties of the different sets of afferents. The 3rd model examines lateral excitatory and inhibitory interactions in such gradients. Model 1 addresses the transformation of distinct thalamic axon properties to a gradient of response properties in postsynaptic spiny stellate neurons in layer 4C of V1. Model 2 proposes circuitry producing orientation specificity in V1 that begins by generating specificity of responses to orthogonal orientations; this is achieved by means of orthogonally oriented lateral axon projections made by the layer 4C spiny stellate neurons; this is followed by generation of a full cycle of orientation specificities by means of pyramidal neuron dendritic overlap across spatially separated fields of spiny stellate neuron axons responding preferentially to orthogonal orientations. Model 3 describes a circuitry to explain inhibitory and facilitatory interactions observed to occur in single unit responses when the classical receptive field is stimulated concurrently with the surround region. All the proposed models make predictions that can be tested by further anatomical and physiological experiments in the real visual cortex.},

abstract = {In this review we re-examine the concept of a cortical column in macaque primary visual cortex, and consider to what extent a functionally defined column reflects any sort of anatomical entity that subdivides cortical territory. Functional studies have shown that columns relating to different response properties are mapped in cortex at different spatial scales. We suggest that these properties first emerge in mid-layer 4C through a combination of thalamic afferent inputs and local intracortical circuitry, and are then transferred to other layers in a columnar fashion, via interlaminar relays, where additional processing occurs. However, several properties are not strictly columnar since they do not appear in all cortical layers. In contrast to the functional column, an anatomically based cortical column is defined most clearly in terms of the reciprocal connections it makes, both via intra-areal lateral connections and inter-areal feedback/feedforward pathways. The column boundaries are reinforced by interplay between lateral inhibition spreading beyond the column boundary and disinhibition within the column. The anatomical column acts as a functionally tuned unit and point of information collation from laterally offset regions and feedback pathways. Thalamic inputs provide the high-contrast receptive field sizes of the column's neurons, intra-areal lateral connections provide their low contrast summation field sizes, and feedback pathways provide surround modulation of receptive fields responses.},

abstract = {Somatostatin-expressing inhibitory (SOM) neurons in the sensory cortex consist mostly of Martinotti cells, which project ascending axons to layer 1. Due to their sparse distribution, the representational properties of these neurons remain largely unknown. By two-photon imaging guided cell-attached recordings, we characterized visual response and receptive field (RF) properties of SOM neurons and parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory (PV) neurons genetically labeled in the mouse primary visual cortex. In contrast to PV neurons, SOM neurons exhibit broader spikes, lower spontaneous firing rates, smaller On/Off subfields, and broader ranges of basic RF properties such as On/Off segregation, orientation and direction tunings. Notably, the level of orientation and direction selectivity is comparable to that of excitatory neurons, from weakly-tuned to highly selective, whereas PV neurons are in general unselective. Strikingly, the evoked spiking responses of SOM cells are ∼3- to 5-fold weaker and 20-25 ms delayed compared with those of PV neurons. The onset latency of the latter is consistent with that of inhibitory input to excitatory neurons. These functional differences between SOM and PV neurons exist in both layer 2/3 and 4. Our results suggest that SOM and PV neurons engage in cortical circuits in different manners: while PV neurons provide fast, strong but untuned feedforward inhibition to excitatory neurons, likely serving as a general gain control for the processing of ascending inputs, SOM neurons with their selective but delayed and weak inhibition may provide more specific gating of later arriving intracortical excitatory inputs on the distal dendrites.},

abstract = {Photoreceptor loss causes irreversible blindness in many retinal diseases. Repair of such damage by cell transplantation is one of the most feasible types of central nervous system repair; photoreceptor degeneration initially leaves the inner retinal circuitry intact and new photoreceptors need only make single, short synaptic connections to contribute to the retinotopic map. So far, brain- and retina-derived stem cells transplanted into adult retina have shown little evidence of being able to integrate into the outer nuclear layer and differentiate into new photoreceptors. Furthermore, there has been no demonstration that transplanted cells form functional synaptic connections with other neurons in the recipient retina or restore visual function. This might be because the mature mammalian retina lacks the ability to accept and incorporate stem cells or to promote photoreceptor differentiation. We hypothesized that committed progenitor or precursor cells at later ontogenetic stages might have a higher probability of success upon transplantation. Here we show that donor cells can integrate into the adult or degenerating retina if they are taken from the developing retina at a time coincident with the peak of rod genesis. These transplanted cells integrate, differentiate into rod photoreceptors, form synaptic connections and improve visual function. Furthermore, we use genetically tagged post-mitotic rod precursors expressing the transcription factor Nrl (ref. 6) (neural retina leucine zipper) to show that successfully integrated rod photoreceptors are derived only from immature post-mitotic rod precursors and not from proliferating progenitor or stem cells. These findings define the ontogenetic stage of donor cells for successful rod photoreceptor transplantation.},

abstract = {Visual deprivation during a developmental sensitive period markedly alters visual cortical response properties, but the changes in intracortical circuitry that underlie these effects are poorly understood. Here we use a slice preparation of rat primary visual cortex to show that 2 d of prior visual deprivation early in life increases the excitability of layer 4 circuitry. Slice recordings showed that spontaneous activity of layer 4 star pyramidal neurons increased 25-fold after 2 d of visual deprivation between postnatal days (P) 15 and P17. This effect was mediated by increased net excitatory and decreased net inhibitory synaptic drive. Paired recordings showed that excitatory connections between star pyramidal neurons doubled in amplitude, whereas inhibitory connections decreased or increased depending on the interneuron class. These effects reversed when vision was restored. This dynamic adjustment of the excitation-inhibition balance may allow the networks within layer 4 to maintain stable levels of activity in the face of variable sensory input.},

abstract = {In primate primary visual cortex, neurons sharing similar response properties are clustered together forming functional domains that appear as a mosaic of patches or bands, often traversing the entire cortical depth from the pia to the white matter. Similarly, each cortical site connects laterally through an extensive network of intrinsic projections that are organized in multiple clusters (patches) and reach distances of up to a few millimeters. The relationship between the functional domains and these laterally connected patches has remained a controversial issue despite intensive research efforts. To investigate this relationship, we obtained high-resolution functional maps of the cortical architecture by in vivo optical imaging. Subsequently, extracellular injections of the sensitive anterograde tracer biocytin were targeted into selected functional domains. Within the ocular dominance system, we found that long-range intrinsic connections tended to link the monocular regions of same-eye ocular dominance columns. Furthermore, we discovered that binocular domains formed a separate set of connections in area V1; binocular regions were selectively connected among themselves but were not connected to strictly monocular regions, suggesting that they constitute a distinct columnar system. In the other subsystem subserving orientation preference, patches of intrinsic connections tended to link domains sharing similar orientation preferences. Analyses of the precision of these connections indicated that in both functional subsystems, < 15\% of the connections were between domains having orthogonal response properties. However, their selectivity was limited; approximately 30\% +/- 10\% of the interconnected patches contained neurons exhibiting orientation tuning that differed from those found at the injection sites by at least 45 degrees. At short range (up to 400 microns from the injection site), this casual trend seemed markedly accentuated; the local, synaptic-rich axonal and dendritic arbors crossed freely through columns of diverse functional properties. These complex sets of connections can endow cortical neurons with a rich diversity of response properties and broad tuning.},

abstract = {The laminar morphology and electrophysiologically determined retinotopic organization of a single rhesus macaque lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) were reconstructed on series of coronal, sagittal, and horizontal cuts through a three-dimensional computer representation of the nucleus. Neurons were counted in this same nucleus, allowing the magnification functions (cells/degree2 as functions of eccentricity) of magnocellular and parvocellular layers to be determined after eliminating the effects of nonuniform volume shrinkage. Parvocellular magnification was approximately 10,000 times higher in the foveola than in the far periphery. On average, magnocellular neurons made up 2.6\% of the LGN in the central 2 degrees (but probably a smaller fraction in the central fovea). The magnocellular portion increased steadily with eccentricity to 27\% in the far periphery. Thus the magno/parvo ratio increases from foveola to far periphery by a factor of at least 14. The parvocellular magnification function matches estimates of cortical magnification, whereas the density of magnocellular afferents to cortex increases monotonically with eccentricity. At the posterior pole of the nucleus, the numbers of layers are reduced through a fusion of two layers and the disappearance of one or two others, a feature that may be associated with the foveal ipsilateral hemifield representation.},

abstract = {Red-green colour blindness, which results from the absence of either the long- (L) or the middle- (M) wavelength-sensitive visual photopigments, is the most common single locus genetic disorder. Here we explore the possibility of curing colour blindness using gene therapy in experiments on adult monkeys that had been colour blind since birth. A third type of cone pigment was added to dichromatic retinas, providing the receptoral basis for trichromatic colour vision. This opened a new avenue to explore the requirements for establishing the neural circuits for a new dimension of colour sensation. Classic visual deprivation experiments have led to the expectation that neural connections established during development would not appropriately process an input that was not present from birth. Therefore, it was believed that the treatment of congenital vision disorders would be ineffective unless administered to the very young. However, here we show that the addition of a third opsin in adult red-green colour-deficient primates was sufficient to produce trichromatic colour vision behaviour. Thus, trichromacy can arise from a single addition of a third cone class and it does not require an early developmental process. This provides a positive outlook for the potential of gene therapy to cure adult vision disorders.},

The computations are often invariant across a cortical area yet are carried out by networks that can vary widely within an area according to its functional architecture. Here we demonstrate a mechanism by which orientation selectivity is computed invariantly in cat primary visual cortex across an orientation preference map that provides a wide diversity of local circuits. Visually evoked excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances are balanced exquisitely in cortical neurons and thus keep the spike response sharply tuned at all map locations. This functional balance derives from spatially isotropic local connectivity of both excitatory and inhibitory cells. Modeling results demonstrate that such covariation is a signature of recurrent rather than purely feed-forward processing and that the observed isotropic local circuit is sufficient to generate invariant spike tuning.},

abstract = {To establish the mouse as a genetically tractable model for high-order visual processing, we characterized fine-scale retinotopic organization of visual cortex and determined functional specialization of layer 2/3 neuronal populations in seven retinotopically identified areas. Each area contains a distinct visuotopic representation and encodes a unique combination of spatiotemporal features. Areas LM, AL, RL, and AM prefer up to three times faster temporal frequencies and significantly lower spatial frequencies than V1, while V1 and PM prefer high spatial and low temporal frequencies. LI prefers both high spatial and temporal frequencies. All extrastriate areas except LI increase orientation selectivity compared to V1, and three areas are significantly more direction selective (AL, RL, and AM). Specific combinations of spatiotemporal representations further distinguish areas. These results reveal that mouse higher visual areas are functionally distinct, and separate groups of areas may be specialized for motion-related versus pattern-related computations, perhaps forming pathways analogous to dorsal and ventral streams in other species.},

We used whole-cell recording in vivo to show the spatial distribution of visually evoked excitatory and inhibitory inputs and to stain individual neurons. We quantified the distribution of 'On' and 'Off' responses and the presence of spatially opponent excitation and inhibition within the receptive field. The thalamorecipient layers (4 and upper 6) were dominated by simple cells, as defined by two criteria: they had separated On and Off subregions, and they had push-pull responses (in a given subregion, stimuli of the opposite contrast evoked responses of the opposite sign). Other types of response profile correlated with laminar location as well. Thus, connections unique to each visual cortical layer are likely to serve distinct functions.},

abstract = {The mammalian retina consists of neurons of >60 distinct types, each playing a specific role in processing visual images. They are arranged in three main stages. The first decomposes the outputs of the rod and cone photoreceptors into ∼12 parallel information streams. The second connects these streams to specific types of retinal ganglion cells. The third combines bipolar and amacrine cell activity to create the diverse encodings of the visual world--roughly 20 of them--that the retina transmits to the brain. New transformations of the visual input continue to be found: at least half of the encodings sent to the brain (ganglion cell response selectivities) remain to be discovered. This diversity of the retina's outputs has yet to be incorporated into our understanding of higher visual function.},

abstract = {We studied the spatial overlap of on and off subregions in macaque primary visual cortex and its relation to the response modulation ratio (the F1/F0 ratio). Spatial maps of on and off subregions were obtained by reverse correlation with a dynamic noise pattern of bright and dark spots. Two spatial maps, on and off, were produced by cross-correlating the spike train with the location of bright and dark spots in the stimulus respectively. Several measures were used to assess the degree of overlap between subregions. In a subset of neurons, we also computed the F1/F0 ratio in response to drifting sinusoidal gratings. Significant correlations were found among all the overlap measures and the F1/F0 ratio. Most overlap indices considered, and the F1/F0 measure, had bimodal distributions. In contrast, the distance between on and off subregions normalized by their size was unimodal. Surprisingly, a simple model that additively combines on and off subregions with spatial separations drawn from a unimodal distribution, can readily explain the data. These analyses clarify the relationship between subregion overlap and the F1/F0 ratio in macaque primary visual cortex, and a simple model provides a parsimonious explanation for the co-existence of bimodal distributions of overlap indices and a unimodal distribution of the normalized distance.},

abstract = {Pyramidal neurons within the cerebral cortex are known to make long-range horizontal connections via an extensive axonal collateral system. The synaptic characteristics and specificities of these connections were studied at the ultrastructural level. Two superficial layer pyramidal cells in the primate striate cortex were labeled by intracellular injections with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and their axon terminals were subsequently examined with the technique of electron microscopic (EM) serial reconstruction. At the light microscopic level both cells showed the characteristic pattern of widespread, clustered axon collaterals. We examined collateral clusters located near the dendritic field (proximal) and approximately 0.5 mm away (distal). The synapses were of the asymmetric/round vesicle variety (type I), and were therefore presumably excitatory. Three-quarters of the postsynaptic targets were the dendritic spines of other pyramidal cells. A few of the axodendritic synapses were with the shafts of pyramidal cells, bringing the proportion of pyramidal cell targets to 80\%. The remaining labeled endings were made with the dendritic shafts of smooth stellate cells, which are presumed to be (GABA)ergic inhibitory cells. On the basis of serial reconstruction of a few of these cells and their dendrites, a likely candidate for one target inhibitory cell is the small-medium basket cell. Taken together, this pattern of outputs suggests a mixture of postsynaptic effects mediated by consequence the horizontal connections may well be the substrate for the variety of influences observed between the receptive field center and its surround.},

abstract = {In this paper, we offer an explanation for how selectivity for orientation could be produced by a model with circuitry that is based on the anatomy of V1 cortex. It is a network model of layer 4Calpha in macaque primary visual cortex (area V1). The model consists of a large number of integrate-and-fire conductance-based point neurons, both excitatory and inhibitory, which represent dynamics in a small patch of 4Calpha-1 mm(2) in lateral area-which contains four orientation hypercolumns. The physiological properties and coupling architectures of the model are derived from experimental data for layer 4Calpha of macaque. Convergent feed-forward input from many neurons of the lateral geniculate nucleus sets up an orientation preference, in a pinwheel pattern with an orientation preference singularity in the center of the pattern. Recurrent cortical connections cause the network to sharpen its selectivity. The pattern of local lateral connections is taken as isotropic, with the spatial range of monosynaptic excitation exceeding that of inhibition. The model (i) obtains sharpening, diversity in selectivity, and dynamics of orientation selectivity, each in qualitative agreement with experiment; and (ii) predicts more sharpening near orientation preference singularities.},

abstract = {Spatially directed attention strongly enhances visual perceptual processing. The metaphor of the "spotlight" has long been used to describe spatial attention; however, there has been considerable debate as to whether spatial attention must be unitary or may be split between discrete regions of space. This question was addressed here through functional MR imaging of human subjects as they performed a task that required simultaneous attention to two briefly displayed and masked targets at locations separated by distractor stimuli. These data reveal retinotopically specific enhanced activation in striate and extrastriate visual cortical representations of the two attended stimuli and no enhancement at the intervening representation of distractor stimuli. This finding of two spotlights was obtained within a single cortical hemisphere and across the two hemispheres. This provides direct evidence that spatial attention can select, in parallel, multiple low-level perceptual representations.},

abstract = {Multiple stimuli present in the visual field at the same time compete for neural representation by mutually suppressing their evoked activity throughout visual cortex, providing a neural correlate for the limited processing capacity of the visual system. Competitive interactions among stimuli can be counteracted by top-down, goal-directed mechanisms such as attention, and by bottom-up, stimulus-driven mechanisms. Because these two processes cooperate in everyday life to bias processing toward behaviorally relevant or particularly salient stimuli, it has proven difficult to study interactions between top-down and bottom-up mechanisms. Here, we used an experimental paradigm in which we first isolated the effects of a bottom-up influence on neural competition by parametrically varying the degree of perceptual grouping in displays that were not attended. Second, we probed the effects of directed attention on the competitive interactions induced with the parametric design. We found that the amount of attentional modulation varied linearly with the degree of competition left unresolved by bottom-up processes, such that attentional modulation was greatest when neural competition was little influenced by bottom-up mechanisms and smallest when competition was strongly influenced by bottom-up mechanisms. These findings suggest that the strength of attentional modulation in the visual system is constrained by the degree to which competitive interactions have been resolved by bottom-up processes related to the segmentation of scenes into candidate objects.},

abstract = {Multiplicative gain control is a vital component of many theoretical analyses of neural computations, conferring the ability to scale neuronal firing rate in response to synaptic inputs. Many theories of gain control in single cells have used precisely balanced noisy inputs. Such noisy inputs can degrade signal processing. We demonstrate a deterministic method for the control of gain without the use of noise. We show that a depolarizing afterpotential (DAP), arising from active dendritic spike backpropagation, leads to a multiplicative increase in gain. Reduction of DAP amplitude by dendritic inhibition dilutes the multiplicative effect, allowing for divisive scaling of the firing rate. In contrast, somatic inhibition acts in a subtractive manner, allowing spatially distinct inhibitory inputs to perform distinct computations. The simplicity of this mechanism and the ubiquity of its elementary components suggest that many cell types have the potential to display a dendritic division of neuronal output.},

abstract = {Mammalian primary visual cortex (V1) is topographically organized such that the pattern of neural activation in V1 reflects the location and spatial extent of visual elements in the retinal image, but it is unclear whether this organization contributes to visual perception. We combined computational modeling, voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) in behaving monkeys and behavioral measurements in humans to investigate whether the large-scale topography of V1 population responses influences shape judgments. Specifically, we used a computational model to design visual stimuli that had the same physical shape, but were predicted to elicit variable V1 response spread. We confirmed these predictions with VSDI. Finally, we designed a behavioral task in which human observers judged the shapes of these stimuli and found that their judgments were systematically distorted by the spread of V1 activity. This illusion suggests that the topographic pattern of neural population responses in visual cortex contributes to visual perception.},

@article{Miller1998,
abstract = {A simple model of correlation-based synaptic plasticity via axonal sprouting and retraction (Elliott, Howarth, \& Shadbolt, 1996a) is shown to be equivalent to the class of correlation-based models (Miller, Keller, \& Stryker, 1989), although these were formulated in terms of weight modification of anatomically fixed synapses. Both models maximize the same measure of synaptic correlation, subject to certain constraints on connectivity. Thus, the analyses of the correlation-based models suffice to characterize the behavior of the sprouting-and-retraction model. More detailed models are needed for theoretical distinctions to be drawn between plasticity via sprouting and retraction, weight modification, or a combination. The model of Elliott et al. involves stochastic search through allowed weight patterns for those that improve correlations. That of Miller et al. instead follows dynamical equations that determine continuous changes of the weights that improve correlations. The identity of these two approaches is shown to depend on the use of subtractive constraint enforcement in the models of Miller et al. More generally, to model the idea that neural development acts to maximize some measure of correlation subject to a constraint on the summed synaptic weight, the constraint must be enforced subtractively in a dynamical model.},

abstract = {Visual stimulation of a region outside the receptive field of single cells in visual cortex often results in the modulation of their responses. The modulatory effects are thought to be mediated through lateral connections within visual cortex. Research on lateral interactions commonly shows suppression. There has been no systematic study of the optimal conditions for facilitation. Here we have studied the nature of the modulation using a new type of compound stimulus: contrast reversal of pattern stimuli made of three discrete grating patches. The middle patch, optimally fitted to the receptive field in orientation, size, and spatial as well as temporal frequencies, was flanked by two similar patches presented well outside the receptive field. We found that (1) both facilitation and suppression occurred often in the same cells, when orientations of the target and flankers matched the receptive-field's optimal orientation; (2) facilitation with collinear flankers occurred most frequently at target contrasts just above the cell's firing threshold and suppression prevailed at high contrasts; (3) facilitative or suppressive modulation was obtained with target-flankers separation of up to 12 deg or more; (4) collinear facilitation was lost when flankers' orientation was rotated by 90 deg, while keeping all other parameters the same; and (5) neither the modulation mode nor the proportion of modulated cells was related to the cell types (simple vs. complex cells) and cells' laminar locations. Here we have provided physiological evidence for contrast-dependent, collinear facilitation probably underlying perceptual grouping in humans.},

abstract = {1. The activity of single neurons was recorded in Macaca mulatta monkeys while they performed tasks requiring them to select a cued stimulus from an array of three to eight stimuli and report the orientation of that stimulus. Stimuli were presented in a circular array centered on the fixation target and scaled to place a single stimulus element within the receptive field of the neuron under study. The timing of the cuing event permitted the directing of visual attention to the spatial location of the correct stimulus before its presentation. 2. The effects of focal attention were examined in cortical visual areas V1, V2, and V4, where a total of 672 neurons were isolated with complete studies obtained for 94 V1, 74 V2, and 74 V4 neurons with receptive-field center eccentricities in the range 1.8-8 degrees. Under certain conditions, directed focal attention results in changes in the response of V1, V2, and V4 neurons to otherwise identical stimuli at spatially specific locations. 3. More than one-third of the neurons in each area displayed differential sensitivity when attention was directed toward versus away from the spatial location of the receptive field just before and during stimulus presentation. Both relative increases and decreases in neural activity were observed in association with attention directed at receptive-field stimuli. 4. The presence of multiple competing stimuli in the visual field was a major factor determining the presence or absence of differential sensitivity. About two-thirds of the neurons that were differentially sensitive to the attending condition in the presence of competing stimuli were not differentially sensitive when single stimuli were presented in control studies. For V1 and V2 neurons the presence of only a few (3-4) competing stimuli was sufficient for a majority of the neurons studied; a majority of the V4 neurons required six to eight stimuli in the array before significant differences between attending conditions occurred. 5. For V1 and V2 neurons the neuronal sensitivity differences between attending conditions were observed primarily at or near the peak of the orientation tuning sensitivity for each neuron; the differences were evident over a broader range of orientations in V4 neurons. 6. In conclusion, neural correlates of focal attentive processes can be observed in visual cortical processing in areas V1 and V2 as well as area V4 under conditions that require stimulus feature analysis and selective spatial processing within a field of competing stimuli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Two experiments found that form discriminations to a target item were inhibited when the target appeared adjacent to an attentionally salient item. Experiment 1 manipulated the attentional salience of an irrelevant color singleton through the attentional set adopted by the subjects. Color singletons captured attention when the target was itself a feature singleton, but not when the target was defined as a conjunction of features. Attentional capture was accompanied by an inhibitory region (i.e., slowed target reaction times), which dissipated with distance from the color singleton. In Experiment 2, the attentional salience of abrupt onsets and color singletons was compared. Irrelevant abrupt onsets captured attention, whereas irrelevant color singletons failed to capture attention. Again, an inhibitory region surrounded the attentionally salient abrupt onsets, but not the color singletons. The results are discussed in the context of current models of visual spatial attention and suggest a distinction between attentional preparation and attentional selection.},

abstract = {Vision in infant primates is poor, but it is not known which structures in the eye or brain set the main limits to its development. We studied the visual response properties of 348 neurons recorded in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of macaque monkeys aged 1 week to adult. We measured spatial and temporal frequency tuning curves and contrast responses with drifting achromatic sinusoidal gratings. Even in animals as young as 1 week, the main visual response properties of neurons in the magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) divisions of the LGN were qualitatively normal, including the spatial organization of receptive fields and the characteristic response properties that differentiate M- and P-cells. At 1 and 4 weeks, spatial and temporal resolution were less than one-half of adult values, whereas contrast gain and peak response rates for optimal stimuli were about two-thirds of adult values. Adult levels were reached by 24 weeks. Analysis of correlations between S-potentials representing retinal inputs and LGN cells suggested that the LGN follows retinal input as faithfully in infants as in adults, implicating retinal development as the main driving force in LGN development. Comparisons with previously published psychophysical data and ideal observer models suggest that the relatively modest changes in LGN responses during maturation impose no significant limits on visual performance. In contrast to previous studies, we conclude that these limits are set by neural development in the visual cortex, not in or peripheral to the LGN.},

abstract = {Simulating from distributions with intractable normalizing constants has been a long-standing problem in machine learning. In this letter, we propose a new algorithm, the Monte Carlo Metropolis-Hastings (MCMH) algorithm, for tackling this problem. The MCMH algorithm is a Monte Carlo version of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. It replaces the unknown normalizing constant ratio by a Monte Carlo estimate in simulations, while still converges, as shown in the letter, to the desired target distribution under mild conditions. The MCMH algorithm is illustrated with spatial autologistic models and exponential random graph models. Unlike other auxiliary variable Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, such as the M\o ller and exchange algorithms, the MCMH algorithm avoids the requirement for perfect sampling, and thus can be applied to many statistical models for which perfect sampling is not available or very expensive. The MCMH algorithm can also be applied to Bayesian inference for random effect models and missing data problems that involve simulations from a distribution with intractable integrals.},

@article{Murphy2009,
abstract = {In cerebral cortex, ongoing activity absent a stimulus can resemble stimulus-driven activity in size and structure. In particular, spontaneous activity in cat primary visual cortex (V1) has structure significantly correlated with evoked responses to oriented stimuli. This suggests that, from unstructured input, cortical circuits selectively amplify specific activity patterns. Current understanding of selective amplification involves elongation of a neural assembly's lifetime by mutual excitation among its neurons. We introduce a new mechanism for selective amplification without elongation of lifetime: "balanced amplification." Strong balanced amplification arises when feedback inhibition stabilizes strong recurrent excitation, a pattern likely to be typical of cortex. Thus, balanced amplification should ubiquitously contribute to cortical activity. Balanced amplification depends on the fact that individual neurons project only excitatory or only inhibitory synapses. This leads to a hidden feedforward connectivity between activity patterns. We show in a detailed biophysical model that this can explain the cat V1 observations.},

These relationships are supported by a close correlation between the functional properties of these areas and the M pathway and by a lack of anatomical evidence for P input. Here we use rabies virus as a retrograde transynaptic tracer to show that the dorsal area MT receives strong input, via a single relay, from both M and P cells of the lateral geniculate nucleus. This surprising P input, likely relayed via layer 6 Meynert cells in primary visual cortex, can provide MT with sensitivity to a more complete range of spatial, temporal, and chromatic cues than the M pathway alone. These observations provide definitive evidence for P pathway input to MT and show that convergence of parallel visual pathways occurs in the dorsal stream.},

The combined organization of these particular tuning properties in the cortical space will strongly shape the V1 population response to different visual inputs, yet it is poorly understood. In this study, we used two-photon imaging in macaque monkey V1 to demonstrate the three-dimensional cell-by-cell layout of both spatial frequency and orientation tuning. We first found that spatial frequency tuning was organized into highly structured maps that remained consistent across the depth of layer II/III, similarly to orientation tuning. Next, we found that orientation and spatial frequency maps were intimately related at the fine spatial scale observed with two-photon imaging. Not only did the map gradients tend notably toward orthogonality, but they also co-varied negatively from cell to cell at the spatial scale of cortical columns.},

Testing these predictions requires the development of new methods that allow the recording of single units at various locations across the orientation map. Here we present a novel technique for the precise alignment of functional maps and array recordings. Our strategy consists of first measuring the orientation maps in V1 using intrinsic optical imaging. A micromachined electrode array is subsequently implanted in the same patch of cortex for electrophysiological recordings, including the measurement of orientation tuning curves. The location of the array within the map is obtained by finding the position that maximizes the agreement between the preferred orientations measured electrically and optically. Experimental results of the alignment procedure from two implementations in monkey V1 are presented. The estimated accuracy of the procedure is evaluated using computer simulations. The methodology should prove useful in studying how signals from the local neighborhood of a neuron, thought to provide a dominant feedback signal, shape the receptive field properties in V1.},

abstract = {We propose a computational model for the task-specific guidance of visual attention in real-world scenes. Our model emphasizes four aspects that are important in biological vision: determining task-relevance of an entity, biasing attention for the low-level visual features of desired targets, recognizing these targets using the same low-level features, and incrementally building a visual map of task-relevance at every scene location. Given a task definition in the form of keywords, the model first determines and stores the task-relevant entities in working memory, using prior knowledge stored in long-term memory. It attempts to detect the most relevant entity by biasing its visual attention system with the entity's learned low-level features. It attends to the most salient location in the scene, and attempts to recognize the attended object through hierarchical matching against object representations stored in long-term memory. It updates its working memory with the task-relevance of the recognized entity and updates a topographic task-relevance map with the location and relevance of the recognized entity. The model is tested on three types of tasks: single-target detection in 343 natural and synthetic images, where biasing for the target accelerates target detection over twofold on average; sequential multiple-target detection in 28 natural images, where biasing, recognition, working memory and long term memory contribute to rapidly finding all targets; and learning a map of likely locations of cars from a video clip filmed while driving on a highway. The model's performance on search for single features and feature conjunctions is consistent with existing psychophysical data. These results of our biologically-motivated architecture suggest that the model may provide a reasonable approximation to many brain processes involved in complex task-driven visual behaviors.},

Understanding of the biology underlying color vision has been vaulted forward through the application of the tools of molecular genetics. For all their complexity, the biological processes responsible for color vision are more accessible than for many other neural systems. This is partly because of the wealth of genetic variations that affect color perception, both within and across species, and because components of the color vision system lend themselves to genetic manipulation. Mutations and rearrangements in the genes encoding the long, middle, and short wavelength sensitive cone pigments are responsible for color vision deficiencies and mutations have been identified that affect the number of cone types, the absorption spectra of the pigments, the functionality and viability of the cones, and the topography of the cone mosaic. The addition of an opsin gene, as occurred in the evolution of primate color vision, and has been done in experimental animals can produce expanded color vision capacities and this has provided insight into the underlying neural circuitry.},

abstract = {The effect of attention on firing rates varies considerably within a single cortical area. The firing rate of some neurons is greatly modulated by attention while others are hardly affected. The reason for this variability across neurons is unknown. We found that the variability in attention modulation across neurons in area MT of macaques can be well explained by variability in the strength of tuned normalization across neurons. The presence of tuned normalization also explains a striking asymmetry in attention effects within neurons: when two stimuli are in a neuron's receptive field, directing attention to the preferred stimulus modulates firing rates more than directing attention to the nonpreferred stimulus. These findings show that much of the neuron-to-neuron variability in modulation of responses by attention depends on variability in the way the neurons process multiple stimuli, rather than differences in the influence of top-down signals related to attention.},

abstract = {Genetic methods available in mice are likely to be powerful tools in dissecting cortical circuits. However, the visual cortex, in which sensory coding has been most thoroughly studied in other species, has essentially been neglected in mice perhaps because of their poor spatial acuity and the lack of columnar organization such as orientation maps. We have now applied quantitative methods to characterize visual receptive fields in mouse primary visual cortex V1 by making extracellular recordings with silicon electrode arrays in anesthetized mice. We used current source density analysis to determine laminar location and spike waveforms to discriminate putative excitatory and inhibitory units. We find that, although the spatial scale of mouse receptive fields is up to one or two orders of magnitude larger, neurons show selectivity for stimulus parameters such as orientation and spatial frequency that is near to that found in other species. Furthermore, typical response properties such as linear versus nonlinear spatial summation (i.e., simple and complex cells) and contrast-invariant tuning are also present in mouse V1 and correlate with laminar position and cell type. Interestingly, we find that putative inhibitory neurons generally have less selective, and nonlinear, responses. This quantitative description of receptive field properties should facilitate the use of mouse visual cortex as a system to address longstanding questions of visual neuroscience and cortical processing.},

abstract = {How the activity of sensory neurons elicits perceptions and guides behavior is central to our understanding of the brain and is a subject of intense investigation in neuroscience. Correlations between the activity of sensory neurons and behavior have been widely observed and are sometimes used to infer how neurons are used to guide a certain behavior. This view is challenged firstly by theoretical considerations that these correlations rely on the existence of correlated noise and its structure, and secondly by recent empirical observations suggesting that such correlated noise is not a fixed network property but that it depends on various sources, and varies with a subject's mental state.},

abstract = {Progress in science depends on the effective exchange of ideas among scientists. New ideas can be assessed and criticized in a meaningful manner only if they are formulated precisely. This applies to simulation studies as well as to experiments and theories. But after more than 50 years of neuronal network simulations, we still lack a clear and common understanding of the role of computational models in neuroscience as well as established practices for describing network models in publications. This hinders the critical evaluation of network models as well as their re-use. We analyze here 14 research papers proposing neuronal network models of different complexity and find widely varying approaches to model descriptions, with regard to both the means of description and the ordering and placement of material. We further observe great variation in the graphical representation of networks and the notation used in equations. Based on our observations, we propose a good model description practice, composed of guidelines for the organization of publications, a checklist for model descriptions, templates for tables presenting model structure, and guidelines for diagrams of networks. The main purpose of this good practice is to trigger a debate about the communication of neuronal network models in a manner comprehensible to humans, as opposed to machine-readable model description languages. We believe that the good model description practice proposed here, together with a number of other recent initiatives on data-, model-, and software-sharing, may lead to a deeper and more fruitful exchange of ideas among computational neuroscientists in years to come. We further hope that work on standardized ways of describing--and thinking about--complex neuronal networks will lead the scientific community to a clearer understanding of high-level concepts in network dynamics, and will thus lead to deeper insights into the function of the brain.},

abstract = {Neurons in cat area 17 can be grouped in 4 different electrophysiological cell classes (regular spiking, intrinsically bursting, chattering, and fast spiking [FS]). However, little is known of the functional properties of these different cell classes. Here we compared orientation and direction selectivity between these cell classes in cat area 17 and found that a subset of FS inhibitory neurons, usually with complex receptive fields, exhibited little selectivity in comparison with other cell types. Differences in occurrence and amplitude of gamma-range membrane fluctuations, as well as in numbers of action potentials in response to optimal visual stimuli, did not parallel differences observed for orientation and direction selectivity. Instead, differences in selectivity resulted mostly from differences in tuning of the membrane potential responses, although variations in spike threshold also contributed: weakly selective FS neurons exhibited both a lower spike threshold and more broadly tuned membrane potential responses in comparison with the other cell classes. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that a subgroup of FS neurons receives connections and possesses intrinsic properties allowing the generation of weakly selective responses. The existence of weakly selective inhibitory neurons is consistent with orientation selectivity models that rely on broadly tuned inhibition.},

We show that the observed structure of the topographic map can arise from a principle of continuous mapping. For the realization of this principle we use a mathematical model that can be interpreted as an adaptive process changing a set of synaptic weights, or synaptic connection strengths, between two layers of cells. The patterns of orientation preference and selectivity generated by the model are similar to the patterns seen in the visual cortex of macaque monkey and cat and correspond to a neural projection that maps a more than two-dimensional feature space onto a two-dimensional cortical surface under the constraint that shape and position of the receptive fields of the neurons very smoothly over the cortical surface.},

abstract = {Neurons in the cerebral cortex are organized into anatomical columns, with ensembles of cells arranged from the surface to the white matter. Within a column, neurons often share functional properties, such as selectivity for stimulus orientation; columns with distinct properties, such as different preferred orientations, tile the cortical surface in orderly patterns. This functional architecture was discovered with the relatively sparse sampling of microelectrode recordings. Optical imaging of membrane voltage or metabolic activity elucidated the overall geometry of functional maps, but is averaged over many cells (resolution >100 microm). Consequently, the purity of functional domains and the precision of the borders between them could not be resolved. Here, we labelled thousands of neurons of the visual cortex with a calcium-sensitive indicator in vivo. We then imaged the activity of neuronal populations at single-cell resolution with two-photon microscopy up to a depth of 400 microm. In rat primary visual cortex, neurons had robust orientation selectivity but there was no discernible local structure; neighbouring neurons often responded to different orientations. In area 18 of cat visual cortex, functional maps were organized at a fine scale. Neurons with opposite preferences for stimulus direction were segregated with extraordinary spatial precision in three dimensions, with columnar borders one to two cells wide. These results indicate that cortical maps can be built with single-cell precision.},

abstract = {Responses of neurons that integrate multiple sensory inputs are traditionally characterized in terms of a set of empirical principles. However, a simple computational framework that accounts for these empirical features of multisensory integration has not been established. We propose that divisive normalization, acting at the stage of multisensory integration, can account for many of the empirical principles of multisensory integration shown by single neurons, such as the principle of inverse effectiveness and the spatial principle. This model, which uses a simple functional operation (normalization) for which there is considerable experimental support, also accounts for the recent observation that the mathematical rule by which multisensory neurons combine their inputs changes with cue reliability. The normalization model, which makes a strong testable prediction regarding cross-modal suppression, may therefore provide a simple unifying computational account of the important features of multisensory integration by neurons.},

abstract = {In the primary visual cortex (V1) of some mammals, columns of neurons with the full range of orientation preferences converge at the center of a pinwheel-like arrangement, the 'pinwheel center' (PWC). Because a neuron receives abundant inputs from nearby neurons, the neuron's position on the cortical map likely has a significant impact on its responses to the layout of orientations inside and outside its classical receptive field (CRF). To understand the positional specificity of responses, we constructed a computational model based on orientation preference maps in monkey V1 and hypothetical neuronal connections. The model simulations showed that neurons near PWCs displayed weaker but detectable orientation selectivity within their CRFs, and strongly reduced contextual modulation from extra-CRF stimuli, than neurons distant from PWCs. We suggest that neurons near PWCs robustly extract local orientation within their CRF embedded in visual scenes, and that contextual information is processed in regions distant from PWCs.},

abstract = {We present a biologically plausible model of an attentional mechanism for forming position- and scale-invariant representations of objects in the visual world. The model relies on a set of control neurons to dynamically modify the synaptic strengths of intracortical connections so that information from a windowed region of primary visual cortex (V1) is selectively routed to higher cortical areas. Local spatial relationships (i.e., topography) within the attentional window are preserved as information is routed through the cortex. This enables attended objects to be represented in higher cortical areas within an object-centered reference frame that is position and scale invariant. We hypothesize that the pulvinar may provide the control signals for routing information through the cortex. The dynamics of the control neurons are governed by simple differential equations that could be realized by neurobiologically plausible circuits. In preattentive mode, the control neurons receive their input from a low-level "saliency map" representing potentially interesting regions of a scene. During the pattern recognition phase, control neurons are driven by the interaction between top-down (memory) and bottom-up (retinal input) sources. The model respects key neurophysiological, neuroanatomical, and psychophysical data relating to attention, and it makes a variety of experimentally testable predictions.},

abstract = {The receptive fields of simple cells in mammalian primary visual cortex can be characterized as being spatially localized, oriented and bandpass (selective to structure at different spatial scales), comparable to the basis functions of wavelet transforms. One approach to understanding such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding. Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence among its outputs.},

abstract = {In what regime does the cortical circuit operate? Our intracellular studies of surround suppression in cat primary visual cortex (V1) provide strong evidence on this question. Although suppression has been thought to arise from an increase in lateral inhibition, we find that the inhibition that cells receive is reduced, not increased, by a surround stimulus. Instead, suppression is mediated by a withdrawal of excitation. Thalamic recordings and previous work show that these effects cannot be explained by a withdrawal of thalamic input. We find in theoretical work that this behavior can only arise if V1 operates as an inhibition-stabilized network (ISN), in which excitatory recurrence alone is strong enough to destabilize visual responses but feedback inhibition maintains stability. We confirm two strong tests of this scenario experimentally and show through simulation that observed cell-to-cell variability in surround effects, from facilitation to suppression, can arise naturally from variability in the ISN.},

We found locally dense connectivity from PV+ interneurons onto PCs across cortical areas and layers. In many experiments, all nearby PV+ cells were connected to every local PC sampled. In agreement with this, we found no evidence for connection specificity, as PV+ interneurons contacted PC pairs similarly regardless of whether they were synaptically connected or not. We conclude that the microcircuit architecture for PV+ interneurons, and probably neocortical inhibition in general, is an unspecific, densely homogenous matrix covering all nearby pyramidal cells.},

abstract = {In spite of the crucial role retinal photoreceptors play in mapping optical images into a pattern of neural excitation, there are no complete studies of photoreceptor topography in any primate retina. We have measured the spatial density and inner segment areas of cones and rods across the whole mounted retinas of three adult pigtail macaques (Macaca nemestrina) and constructed maps of photoreceptor density and inner segment diameter. These retinas contain an average of 3.1 million cones (2.8-3.3 million), with an average peak foveal cone density of 210,000 cones/mm2 (190,000-260,000 cones/mm2). Cone density falls steeply with increasing eccentricity, to 100,000 cones/mm2 at 200 microns from the fovea, and to 50,000 cones/mm2 at 750 microns. Imposed on this gradient is a "streak" of higher cone density along the horizontal meridian. At equivalent eccentricities, cone density is higher in nasal and inferior retina. Cone inner segments increase in diameter from 2.3 microns at the foveal center to 11 microns in far temporal retina and 10 microns in far nasal retina. These retinas contain an average of 60.1 million rods (44.9-75.3 million). Rod density is zero within 20 microns of the foveal center, increases to the crest of a "rod ring" at the eccentricity of the optic disk, and then declines. Central rod topography is asymmetric, with higher densities in superior retina. Density along the crest of the rod ring peaks in superior retina at 177,000 rods/mm2, dips as low as 120,000 rods/mm2 along the horizontal meridian, and increases to about 150,000 rods/mm2 in inferior retina. Far peripheral rod topography is relatively symmetric around the fovea. Rod inner segment diameter ranged from 1.5 microns in the fovea to 4 microns at the temporal edge and 3.4 microns at the nasal edge of the retina. At eccentricities exceeding 6 mm, rod inner segment diameter was greater temporally than nasally. Cone inner segments cover 85-90\% of the central fovea, with extrareceptor space accounting for the remainder. Cone coverage declines with increasing eccentricity to 20\% at the temporal edge and 35\% at the nasal edge of the retina. In contrast, rod coverage increases from zero at the foveal center to a maximum of 65\% in temporal retina and 50\% in nasal retina. The photoreceptor topography of the pigtail macaque is qualitatively similar to that of other macaques and to humans. Photoreceptor topography is formed by a complex interaction between regional changes in cone and rod density and inner segment diameter.},

abstract = {What are the shape and size of the region in primate V1 that processes information from a single point in visual space? This region, a fundamental property termed cortical point image (CPI) (McIlwain 1986), represents the minimal population of V1 neurons that can be activated by a visual stimulus and therefore has important implications for population coding in the cortex. Previous indirect attempts to measure the CPI in macaque V1 using sparse microelectrode recordings resulted in conflicting findings. Whereas some early studies suggested that CPI size is constant throughout V1 (e.g., Hubel and Wiesel 1974), others have reported large changes in CPI size in parafoveal V1 (e.g., Van Essen et al. 1984). To resolve this controversy, we used voltage-sensitive dye imaging in V1 of fixating monkeys to directly measure the subthreshold CPI and several related properties across a range of parafoveal eccentricities. We found that despite large changes in other properties of the retinotopic map, the subthreshold CPI is approximately constant and extends over ∼6 × 8 mm(2). This large and invariant CPI ensures a uniform representation of each point in visual space, with a complete representation of all visual features in V1, as originally proposed by Hubel and Wiesel (1974). In addition, we found several novel and unexpected asymmetries and anisotropies in the shapes of the CPI and the population receptive field. These results expand our understanding of the representation of visual space in V1 and are likely to be relevant for the representations of stimuli in other sensory cortical areas.},

abstract = {Recent stimulus history-adaptation-alters neuronal responses and perception. Previous electrophysiological and perceptual studies suggest that prolonged adaptation strengthens and makes more persistent the effects seen after briefer exposures. However, no systematic comparison has been made between the effects of adaptation lasting hundreds of milliseconds, which might arise during a single fixation, and the more prolonged adaptation typically used in imaging and perceptual studies. Here we determine how 0.4, 4, and 40 s of adaptation alters orientation tuning in primary visual cortex of anesthetized macaque monkeys, and how quickly responses recover after adapter offset. We measured responses to small (1.3°) and large (7.4°) gratings because previous work has shown that adaptation effects can depend on stimulus size. Adaptation with small gratings reduced responsivity and caused tuning to shift away from the adapter. These effects strengthened with more prolonged adaptation. For responses to large gratings, brief and prolonged adaptation produced indistinguishable effects on responsivity but caused opposite shifts in tuning preference. Recovery from adaptation was notably slower after prolonged adaptation, even when this did not induce stronger effects. We show that our results can be explained by an adaptation-induced weakening of surround suppression, the dynamics of this suppression, and differential effects of brief and prolonged adaptation across response epochs. Our findings show that effects do not simply scale with adaptation duration and suggest that distinct strategies exist for adjusting to moment-to-moment fluctuations in input and to more persistent visual stimuli.},

abstract = {Cell transplantation is a potential strategy for treating blindness caused by the loss of photoreceptors. Although transplanted rod-precursor cells are able to migrate into the adult retina and differentiate to acquire the specialized morphological features of mature photoreceptor cells, the fundamental question remains whether transplantation of photoreceptor cells can actually improve vision. Here we provide evidence of functional rod-mediated vision after photoreceptor transplantation in adult Gnat1−/− mice, which lack rod function and are a model of congenital stationary night blindness. We show that transplanted rod precursors form classic triad synaptic connections with second-order bipolar and horizontal cells in the recipient retina. The newly integrated photoreceptor cells are light-responsive with dim-flash kinetics similar to adult wild-type photoreceptors. By using intrinsic imaging under scotopic conditions we demonstrate that visual signals generated by transplanted rods are projected to higher visual areas, including V1. Moreover, these cells are capable of driving optokinetic head tracking and visually guided behaviour in the Gnat1−/− mouse under scotopic conditions. Together, these results demonstrate the feasibility of photoreceptor transplantation as a therapeutic strategy for restoring vision after retinal degeneration.},

abstract = {Analysis and interpretation of a visual scene to extract its cate- gory, such as whether it contains an animal, is typically assumed to involve higher-level associative brain areas. Previous propos- als have been based on a series of processing steps organized in amulti-level hierarchy thatwould progressively analyze the scene at increasing levels of abstraction, fromcontour extraction to low- level object recognition and finally to object categorization (Serre, PNAS 2007). We explore here an alternative hypothesis that the statistics of edge co-occurences are sufficient to perform a rough yet robust (translation, scale, and rotation invariant) scene cate- gorization. The method is based on a realistic model of image analysis in the primary visual cortex that extends previous work from Geisler et al. (Vis. Res. 2001). Using a scale-space analysis coupled with a sparse coding algorithm, we achieved detailed and robust extraction of edges in different sets of natural images. This edge-based representation allows for a simple characterization of the “association field” of edges by computing the statistics of co- occurrences. We showthat the geometry of angles made between edges is sufficient to distinguish between different sets of natural images taken in a variety of environments (natural, man-made, or containing an animal). Specifically, a simple classifier, working solely on the basis of this geometry, gives performance similar to that of hierarchical models and of humans in rapid-categorization tasks. Such results call attention to the importance of the relative geometry of local image patches in visual computation, with im- plications for designing efficient image analysis systems. Most importantly, they challenge assumptions about the flow of com- putations in the visual system and emphasize the relative impor- tance in this process of associative connections, and in particular of intra-areal lateral connections.},

We show that human contrast sensitivity is similarly affected by two distinct suppression mechanisms. In agreement with the animal studies, human surround suppression is tightly tuned to the orientation and spatial frequency of the test, unlike overlay suppression. Using a double-masking paradigm, we also show that in humans, overlay suppression precedes surround suppression in the processing sequence. Surprisingly, we find that, unlike overlay suppression, surround suppression is only strong in the periphery (> 1 degree eccentricity). This result argues for a new functional distinction between foveal and peripheral operations.},

abstract = {It is worthwhile to search for forms of coding, processing, and learning common to various cortical regions and cognitive functions. Local cortical processors may coordinate their activity by maximizing the transmission of information coherently related to the context in which it occurs, thus forming synchronized population codes. This coordination involves contextual field (CF) connections that link processors within and between cortical regions. The effects of CF connections are distinguished from those mediating receptive field (RF) input; it is shown how CFs can guide both learning and processing without becoming confused with the transmission of RF information. Simulations explore the capabilities of networks built from local processors with both RF and CF connections. Physiological evidence for synchronization, CFs, and plasticity of the RF and CF connections is described. Coordination via CFs is related to perceptual grouping, the effects of context on contrast sensitivity, amblyopia, implicit influences of color in achromotopsia, object and word perception, and the discovery of distal environmental variables and their interactions through self-organization. Cortical computation could thus involve the flexible evaluation of relations between input signals by locally specialized but adaptive processors whose activity is dynamically associated and coordinated within and between regions through specialized contextual connections.},

abstract = {Statistical dependencies in the responses of sensory neurons govern both the amount of stimulus information conveyed and the means by which downstream neurons can extract it. Although a variety of measurements indicate the existence of such dependencies, their origin and importance for neural coding are poorly understood. Here we analyse the functional significance of correlated firing in a complete population of macaque parasol retinal ganglion cells using a model of multi-neuron spike responses. The model, with parameters fit directly to physiological data, simultaneously captures both the stimulus dependence and detailed spatio-temporal correlations in population responses, and provides two insights into the structure of the neural code. First, neural encoding at the population level is less noisy than one would expect from the variability of individual neurons: spike times are more precise, and can be predicted more accurately when the spiking of neighbouring neurons is taken into account. Second, correlations provide additional sensory information: optimal, model-based decoding that exploits the response correlation structure extracts 20\% more information about the visual scene than decoding under the assumption of independence, and preserves 40\% more visual information than optimal linear decoding. This model-based approach reveals the role of correlated activity in the retinal coding of visual stimuli, and provides a general framework for understanding the importance of correlated activity in populations of neurons.},

abstract = {The basal forebrain provides the primary source of cholinergic input to the cortex, and it has a crucial function in promoting wakefulness and arousal. However, whether rapid changes in basal forebrain neuron spiking in awake animals can dynamically influence sensory perception is unclear. Here we show that basal forebrain cholinergic neurons rapidly regulate cortical activity and visual perception in awake, behaving mice. Optogenetic activation of the cholinergic neurons or their V1 axon terminals improved performance of a visual discrimination task on a trial-by-trial basis. In V1, basal forebrain activation enhanced visual responses and desynchronized neuronal spiking; these changes could partly account for the behavioral improvement. Conversely, optogenetic basal forebrain inactivation decreased behavioral performance, synchronized cortical activity and impaired visual responses, indicating the importance of cholinergic activity in normal visual processing. These results underscore the causal role of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in fast, bidirectional modulation of cortical processing and sensory perception.},

In the visual system, the thalamic lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) is generally thought to encode simple center-surround receptive fields, which are combined into more sophisticated features in cortex, such as orientation and direction selectivity. However, recent evidence suggests that a more diverse set of retinal ganglion cells projects to the LGN. We therefore used multisite extracellular recordings to define the repertoire of visual features represented in the LGN of mouse, an emerging model for visual processing. In addition to center-surround cells, we discovered a substantial population with more selective coding properties, including direction and orientation selectivity, as well as neurons that signal absence of contrast in a visual scene. The direction and orientation selective neurons were enriched in regions that match the termination zones of direction selective ganglion cells from the retina, suggesting a source for their tuning. Together, these data demonstrate that the mouse LGN contains a far more elaborate representation of the visual scene than current models posit. These findings should therefore have a significant impact on our understanding of the computations performed in mouse visual cortex.},

We found that the membrane potential of all cell types became more depolarized and (with the exception of somatostatin-positive interneurons) less variable during locomotion. Cholinergic input was essential for maintaining the unimodal membrane potential distribution during immobility, whereas noradrenergic input was necessary for the tonic depolarization associated with locomotion. Our results provide a mechanism for how neuromodulation controls the gain and signal-to-noise ratio of visual cortical neurons during changes in the state of vigilance.},

abstract = {The perceptual salience and visibility of image elements is influenced by other elements in their vicinity. The perceptual effect of image elements on an adjacent target element depends on their relative orientation. Collinear flanking elements usually improve sensitivity for the target element, whereas orthogonal elements have a weaker effect. It is believed that the collinear flankers exert these effects through lateral interactions between neurons in the primary visual cortex (area V1), but the precise mechanisms underlying these contextual interactions remain unknown. Here, we directly examined this question by recording the effects of flankers on the responses of V1 neurons at parafoveal representations while monkeys performed a fixation task or a contrast detection task. We found, unexpectedly, that collinear flankers reduce the monkeys' perceptual sensitivity for a central target element. This behavioral effect was explained by a flanker-induced increase in the activity of V1 neurons in the absence of the central target stimulus, which reduced the amplitude of the target response. Our results indicate that the dominant effect of collinear flankers in parafoveal vision is suppression and suggest that these suppressive effects are caused by a decrease in the dynamic range of neurons coding the central target.},

abstract = {The visual system encodes the features of visual stimuli as well as their behavioral relevance. Stimuli with a high luminance contrast evoke more activity in the visual cortex than stimuli with a low contrast. At the same time, attended stimuli evoke more activity than nonattended stimuli. There is a debate about how visual features and attention jointly determine neuronal activity in the visual cortex. Some studies suggested that attention increases apparent contrast (Reynolds et al., 2000), others that attention amplifies responses by a constant factor (Williford and Maunsell, 2006), and yet others that attention and contrast have largely additive effects (Buracas and Boynton, 2007; Thiele et al., 2009). The influence of attention on contrast sensitivity differs between neurons, raising the possibility that attention and contrast could be coded conjointly in a population of neurons. Here we investigate this possibility by recording neuronal activity at multiple sites in the primary visual cortex of macaque monkeys using multielectrode recording techniques and support vector machines to decode attended stimuli as well as stimulus contrast. We find that many, but not all, V1 neurons are influenced by attention and that the effects of attention and contrast are additive on average. Stimulus contrast can be decoded from neuronal responses not strongly modulated by attention, whereas the attended stimulus can be decoded as the difference in activity of cells that are influenced by attention and cells that are not. The success of the approach suggests that visual attention and stimulus contrast are represented by largely separable codes.},

abstract = {Our visual system segments images into objects and background. Figure-ground segregation relies on the detection of feature discontinuities that signal boundaries between the figures and the background and on a complementary region-filling process that groups together image regions with similar features. The neuronal mechanisms for these processes are not well understood and it is unknown how they depend on visual attention. We measured neuronal activity in V1 and V4 in a task where monkeys either made an eye movement to texture-defined figures or ignored them. V1 activity predicted the timing and the direction of the saccade if the figures were task relevant. We found that boundary detection is an early process that depends little on attention, whereas region filling occurs later and is facilitated by visual attention, which acts in an object-based manner. Our findings are explained by a model with local, bottom-up computations for boundary detection and feedback processing for region filling.},

abstract = {Detection of a visual signal requires information to reach a system capable of eliciting arbitrary responses required by the experimenter. Detection latencies are reduced when subjects receive a cue that indicates where in the visual field the signal will occur. This shift in efficiency appears to be due to an alignment (orienting) of the central attentional system with the pathways to be activated by the visual input. It would also be possible to describe these results as being due to a reduced criterion at the expected target position. However, this description ignores important constraints about the way in which expectancy improves performance. First, when subjects are cued on each trial, they show stronger expectancy effects than when a probable position is held constant for a block, indicating the active nature of the expectancy. Second, while information on spatial position improves performance, information on the form of the stimulus does not. Third, expectancy may lead to improvements in latency without a reduction in accuracy. Fourth, there appears to be little ability to lower the criterion at two positions that are not spatially contiguous. A framework involving the employment of a limited-capacity attentional mechanism seems to capture these constraints better than the more general language of criterion setting. Using this framework, we find that attention shifts are not closely related to the saccadic eye movement system. For luminance detection the retina appears to be equipotential with respect to attention shifts, since costs to unexpected stimuli are similar whether foveal or peripheral. These results appear to provide an important model system for the study of the relationship between attention and the structure of the visual system.},

We found that the amplitude of excitatory synaptic currents necessary to fire rodent pyramidal cells, the threshold excitatory current, increased with stimulus strength. Consequently, the relative contribution of individual afferents in firing a neuron was inversely proportional to the total number of active afferents. Feedforward inhibition, acting homogeneously across pyramidal cells, ensured that threshold excitatory currents increased with stimulus strength. In contrast, heterogeneities in the distribution of excitatory currents in the neuronal population determined the specific set of pyramidal cells recruited. Together, these mechanisms expand the range of afferent input strengths that neuronal populations can represent.},

abstract = {In simple cells of the cat primary visual cortex, null-oriented stimuli, which by themselves evoke no response, can completely suppress the spiking response to optimally oriented stimuli. This cross-orientation suppression has been interpreted as evidence for cross-orientation inhibition: synaptic inhibition among cortical cells with different preferred orientations. In intracellular recordings from simple cells, however, we found that cross-oriented stimuli suppressed, rather than enhanced, synaptic inhibition and, at the same time, suppressed synaptic excitation. Much of the suppression of excitation could be accounted for by the behavior of geniculate relay cells: contrast saturation and rectification in relay cell responses, when applied to a linear feed-forward model, predicted cross-orientation suppression of the modulation (F1) component of excitation evoked in simple cells. In addition, we found that the suppression of the spike output of simple cells was almost twice the suppression of their synaptic inputs. Thus, cross-orientation suppression, like orientation selectivity, is strongly amplified by threshold.},

abstract = {One of the most exciting and open research frontiers in neuroscience is that of seeking to understand the functional roles of the layers of cerebral cortex. New experimental techniques for probing the laminar circuitry of cortex have recently been developed, opening up novel opportunities for investigating how its six-layered architecture contributes to perception and cognition. The task of trying to interpret this complex structure can be facilitated by theoretical analyses of the types of computations that cortex is carrying out, and of how these might be implemented in specific cortical circuits. We have recently developed a detailed neural model of how the parvocellular stream of the visual cortex utilizes its feedforward, feedback and horizontal interactions for purposes of visual filtering, attention and perceptual grouping. This model, called LAMINART, shows how these perceptual processes relate to the mechanisms that ensure the stable development of cortical circuits in the infant, and to the continued stability of learning in the adult. The present article reviews this laminar theory of visual cortex, considers how it may be generalized towards a more comprehensive theory that encompasses other cortical areas and cognitive processes, and shows how its laminar framework generates a variety of testable predictions.},

abstract = {The primary visual cortex (V1) changes its computation according to the perceptual task being performed. We propose that this cognitive modulation results from gating of V1 intrinsic connections. To test this idea, using behavioral paradigms that engage top-down modulation of V1 contextual interactions, we recorded from chronically implanted electrode arrays in macaques. We observed task-dependent changes in interactions between V1 sites measured both by correlation between spike trains and by coherence between local field potentials (LFP-LFP coherence). The direction of the changes in aggregate activity, as measured by LFPs, depended on perceptual strategy: perceptual grouping increased LFP coherence between sites crucial for the task, whereas perceptual segregation lowered the LFP coherence. Using spiking activity as a measure, we found that the behaviorally driven changes in correlation structure between neurons dramatically increased the stimulus-related information that they convey; this additional increase in encoded information at the level of neuronal ensembles equals that obtained from task-driven reconfigurations of neural tuning curves. The improvements in information encoding were strongest for stimuli with greatest discrimination difficulty.},

@article{Ramsden2001,
abstract = {It is known that neurons in area V2 (the second visual area) can signal the orientation of illusory contours in the primate. Whether area V1 (primary visual cortex) can signal illusory contour orientation is more controversial. While some electrophysiology studies have ruled out illusory signaling in V1, other reports suggest that V1 shows some illusory-specific response. Here, using optical imaging and single unit electrophysiology, we report that primate V1 does show an orientation-specific response to the 'abutting line grating' illusory contour. However, this response does not signal an illusory contour in the conventional sense. Rather, we find that illusory contour stimulation leads to an activation map that, after appropriate subtraction of real line signal, is inversely related to the real orientation map. The illusory contour orientation is thus negatively signaled or de-emphasized in V1. This 'activation reversal' is robust, is not due merely to presence of line ends, is not dependent on inducer orientation, and is not due to precise position of line end stimulation of V1 cells. These data suggest a resolution for previous apparently contradictory experimental findings. We propose that the de-emphasis of illusory contour orientation in V1 may be an important signal of contour identity and may, together with illusory signal from V2, provide a unique signature for illusory contour representation.},

A subset of neurons responsible for carrying the residual errors showed endstopping and other extra-classical receptive-field effects.

abstract = {We report a novel multisensory decision task designed to encourage subjects to combine information across both time and sensory modalities. We presented subjects, humans and rats, with multisensory event streams, consisting of a series of brief auditory and/or visual events. Subjects made judgments about whether the event rate of these streams was high or low. We have three main findings. First, we report that subjects can combine multisensory information over time to improve judgments about whether a fluctuating rate is high or low. Importantly, the improvement we observed was frequently close to, or better than, the statistically optimal prediction. Second, we found that subjects showed a clear multisensory enhancement both when the inputs in each modality were redundant and when they provided independent evidence about the rate. This latter finding suggests a model where event rates are estimated separately for each modality and fused at a later stage. Finally, because a similar multisensory enhancement was observed in both humans and rats, we conclude that the ability to optimally exploit sequentially presented multisensory information is not restricted to a particular species.},

By recording from monosynaptically connected pairs of retinal ganglion cells and LGN neurons in vivo in the cat, we show that relayed spikes are more likely than nonrelayed spikes to be evoked by stimuli that match the receptive fields of the recorded cells and that an interspike interval-based mechanism contributes to the process. Relayed spikes are also more reliable in their timing and number where they often achieve the theoretical limit of minimum variance. As a result, relayed spikes carry more visual information per spike. Based on these results, we conclude that retinogeniculate processing increases sparseness in the neural code by selectively relaying the highest fidelity spikes to the visual cortex.},

abstract = {Several theories propose that the cortex implements an internal model to explain, predict, and learn about sensory data, but the nature of this model is unclear. One condition that could be highly informative here is Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS), where loss of vision leads to complex, vivid visual hallucinations of objects, people, and whole scenes. CBS could be taken as indication that there is a generative model in the brain, specifically one that can synthesise rich, consistent visual representations even in the absence of actual visual input. The processes that lead to CBS are poorly understood. Here, we argue that a model recently introduced in machine learning, the deep Boltzmann machine (DBM), could capture the relevant aspects of (hypothetical) generative processing in the cortex. The DBM carries both the semantics of a probabilistic generative model and of a neural network. The latter allows us to model a concrete neural mechanism that could underlie CBS, namely, homeostatic regulation of neuronal activity. We show that homeostatic plasticity could serve to make the learnt internal model robust against e.g. degradation of sensory input, but overcompensate in the case of CBS, leading to hallucinations. We demonstrate how a wide range of features of CBS can be explained in the model and suggest a potential role for the neuromodulator acetylcholine. This work constitutes the first concrete computational model of CBS and the first application of the DBM as a model in computational neuroscience. Our results lend further credence to the hypothesis of a generative model in the brain.},

abstract = {We have used Sutter's (1987) spatiotemporal m-sequence method to map the receptive fields of neurons in the visual system of the cat. The stimulus consisted of a grid of 16 x 16 square regions, each of which was modulated in time by a pseudorandom binary signal, known as an m-sequence. Several strategies for displaying the m-sequence stimulus are presented. The results of the method are illustrated with two examples. For both geniculate neurons and cortical simple cells, the measurement of first-order response properties with the m-sequence method provided a detailed characterization of classical receptive-field structures. First, we measured a spatiotemporal map of both the center and surround of a Y-cell in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). The time courses of the center responses was biphasic: OFF at short latencies, ON at longer latencies. The surround was also biphasic--ON then OFF--but somewhat slower. Second, we mapped the response properties of an area 17 directional simple cell. The response dynamics of the ON and OFF subregions varied considerably; the time to peak ranged over more than a factor of two. This spatiotemporal inseparability is related to the cell's directional selectivity (Reid et al., 1987, 1991; McLean \& Palmer, 1989; McLean et al., 1994).

abstract = {To efficiently drive many behaviors, sensory systems have to integrate the activity of large neuronal populations within a limited time window. These populations need to rapidly achieve a robust representation of the input image, probably through canonical computations such as divisive normalization. However, little is known about the dynamics of the corticocortical interactions implementing these rapid and robust computations. Here, we measured the real-time activity of a large neuronal population in V1 using voltage-sensitive dye imaging in behaving monkeys. We found that contrast gain of the population increases over time with a time constant of \~{}30 ms and propagates laterally over the cortical surface. This dynamic is well accounted for by a divisive normalization achieved through a recurrent network that transiently increases in size after response onset with a slow swelling speed of 0.007-0.014 m/s, suggesting a polysynaptic intracortical origin. In the presence of a surround, this normalization pool is gradually balanced by lateral inputs propagating from distant cortical locations. This results in a centripetal propagation of surround suppression at a speed of 0.1-0.3 m/s, congruent with horizontal intracortical axons speed. We propose that a simple generalized normalization scheme can account for both the dynamical contrast response function through recurrent polysynaptic intracortical loops and for the surround suppression through long-range monosynaptic horizontal spread. Our results demonstrate that V1 achieves a rapid and robust context-dependent input normalization through a timely push-pull between local and lateral networks. We suggest that divisive normalization, a fundamental canonical computation, should be considered as a dynamic process.},

abstract = {It is well established that attention modulates visual processing in extrastriate cortex. However, the underlying neural mechanisms are unknown. A consistent observation is that attention has its greatest impact on neuronal responses when multiple stimuli appear together within a cell's receptive field. One way to explain this is to assume that multiple stimuli activate competing populations of neurons and that attention biases this competition in favor of the attended stimulus. In the absence of competing stimuli, there is no competition to be resolved. Accordingly, attention has a more limited effect on the neuronal response to a single stimulus. To test this interpretation, we measured the responses of neurons in macaque areas V2 and V4 using a behavioral paradigm that allowed us to isolate automatic sensory processing mechanisms from attentional effects. First, we measured each cell's response to a single stimulus presented alone inside the receptive field or paired with a second receptive field stimulus, while the monkey attended to a location outside the receptive field. Adding the second stimulus typically caused the neuron's response to move toward the response that was elicited by the second stimulus alone. Then, we directed the monkey's attention to one element of the pair. This drove the neuron's response toward the response elicited when the attended stimulus appeared alone. These findings are consistent with the idea that attention biases competitive interactions among neurons, causing them to respond primarily to the attended stimulus. A quantitative neural model of attention is proposed to account for these results.},

abstract = {Single-unit recording studies in the macaque have carefully documented the modulatory effects of attention on the response properties of visual cortical neurons. Attention produces qualitatively different effects on firing rate, depending on whether a stimulus appears alone or accompanied by distracters. Studies of contrast gain control in anesthetized mammals have found parallel patterns of results when the luminance contrast of a stimulus increases. This finding suggests that attention has co-opted the circuits that mediate contrast gain control and that it operates by increasing the effective contrast of the attended stimulus. Consistent with this idea, microstimulation of the frontal eye fields, one of several areas that control the allocation of spatial attention, induces spatially local increases in sensitivity both at the behavioral level and among neurons in area V4, where endogenously generated attention increases contrast sensitivity. Studies in the slice have begun to explain how modulatory signals might cause such increases in sensitivity.},

We show that if the neuron can be modeled as a spatiotemporal linear filter followed by a static nonlinearity, the cross-correlation between the input image sequence and the cell's spike train output gives the projection of the receptive field onto the subspace spanned by S. The technique has been applied to the analysis of simple cells in the primary visual cortex of cats and macaque monkeys. Experimental results are presented where S spans a subspace of spatially low-pass signals.

How the brain wires these circuits in the early stages of development remains unknown. Possible explanations include activity-dependent mechanisms driven by spontaneous activity in the retina and thalamus, and molecular guidance orchestrating thalamo-cortical connections on a fine spatial scale. Here I propose an alternative hypothesis: the blueprint for receptive fields, feature maps, and their inter-relationships may reside in the layout of the retinal ganglion cell mosaics along with a simple statistical connectivity scheme dictating the wiring between thalamus and cortex. The model is shown to account for a number of experimental findings, including the relationship between retinotopy, orientation maps, spatial frequency maps and cytochrome oxidase patches. The theory's simplicity, explanatory and predictive power makes it a serious candidate for the origin of the functional architecture of primary visual cortex.},

abstract = {I present measurements of the spatial structure of simple-cell receptive fields in macaque primary visual cortex (area V1). Similar to previous findings in cat area 17, the spatial profile of simple-cell receptive fields in the macaque is well described by two-dimensional Gabor functions. A population analysis reveals that the distribution of spatial profiles in primary visual cortex lies approximately on a one-parameter family of filter shapes. Surprisingly, the receptive fields cluster into even- and odd-symmetry classes with a tendency for neurons that are well tuned in orientation and spatial frequency to have odd-symmetric receptive fields. The filter shapes predicted by two recent theories of simple-cell receptive field function, independent component analysis and sparse coding, are compared with the data. Both theories predict receptive fields with a larger number of subfields than observed in the experimental data. In addition, these theories do not generate receptive fields that are broadly tuned in orientation and low-pass in spatial frequency, which are commonly seen in monkey V1. The implications of these results for our understanding of image coding and representation in primary visual cortex are discussed.},

abstract = {Probing the visual system with the ensemble of signals that occur in the natural environment may reveal aspects of processing that are not evident in the neural responses to artificial stimulus sets, such as conventional bars and sinusoidal gratings. However, unsolved is the question of how to use complex natural stimulation, many aspects of which the experimenter cannot completely specify, to study neural processing. Here a method is presented to investigate the structure of a neuron's receptive field based on its response to movie clips and other stimulus ensembles. As a particular case, the technique provides an estimate of the conventional first-order receptive field of a neuron, similar to what can be obtained with other reverse-correlation schemes. This is demonstrated experimentally and with computer simulations. Our analysis also revealed that the receptive fields of both simple and complex cells had regions where image boundaries, independent of their contrast sign, would enhance or suppress the cell's response. In some cases, these signals were tuned for the orientation of the boundary. This demonstrates for the first time that it might be feasible to investigate the receptive field structure of visual neurons from their responses to natural image sequences.},

abstract = {We studied the steady-state orientation selectivity of single neurons in macaque primary visual cortex (V1). To analyze the data, two measures of orientation tuning selectivity, circular variance and orientation bandwidth, were computed from the tuning curves. Circular variance is a global measure of the shape of the tuning curve, whereas orientation bandwidth is a local measure of the sharpness of the tuning curve around its peak. Circular variance in V1 was distributed broadly, indicating a great diversity of orientation selectivity. This diversity was also reflected in the individual cortical layers. However, there was a tendency for neurons with high circular variance, meaning low selectivity for orientation, to be concentrated in layers 4C, 3B, and 5. The relative variation of orientation bandwidth across the cortical layers was less than for circular variance, but it showed a similar laminar dependence. Neurons with large orientation bandwidth were found predominantly in layers 4C and 3B. There was a weak correlation between orientation selectivity and the level of spontaneous activity of the neurons. We also assigned a response modulation ratio for each cell, which is a measure of the linearity of spatial summation. Cells with low modulation ratios tended to have higher circular variance and bandwidth than those with high modulation ratios. These findings suggest a revision to the classical view that nonoriented receptive fields are principally found in layer 4C and the cytochrome oxidase-rich blobs in layer 2/3. Instead, a broad distribution of tuning selectivity is found in all cortical layers, and neurons that are weakly tuned for orientation are ubiquitous in V1 cortex.},

We demonstrate that attention is better described as a mechanism by which task relevant information impacts on ongoing processing, while excluding task irrelevant information. We asked subjects to judge the orientation of a target relative to a reference, in a single and dual task setting. The target orientation percept was systematically influenced by the presentation of prior spatio-temporal context. We found that the sign of the context influence depended on target contrast, but its strength depended on the level of attention devoted to the task. Thus the effects of attention and contrast were fundamentally different; contrast influenced the sign of contextual interactions, while attention suppressed these interactions irrespective of their sign.},

abstract = {Recent in vitro studies have shown that acetylcholine (ACh) selectively reduces the efficacy of lateral cortical connections via a muscarinic mechanism, while boosting the efficacy of thalamocortical/feed-forward connections via a nicotinic mechanism. This suggests that high levels of ACh should reduce center-surround interactions of neurons in primary visual cortex, making cells more reliant on feed-forward information. In line with this hypothesis, we show that local iontophoretic application of ACh in primate primary visual cortex reduced the extent of spatial integration, assessed by recording a neurons' length tuning. When ACh was externally applied, neurons' preferred length shifted toward shorter bars, showing reduced impact of the extra-classical receptive field. We fitted a difference and a ratio of Gaussian model to these data to determine the underlying mechanisms of this dynamic change of spatial integration. These models assume overlapping summation and suppression areas with different widths and gains to be responsible for spatial integration and size tuning. ACh significantly reduced the extent of the summation area, but had no significant effect on the extent of the suppression area. In line with previous studies, we also show that applying ACh enhanced the response in the majority of cells, especially in the later (sustained) part of the response. These findings are similar to effects of attention on neuronal activity. The natural release of ACh is strongly linked with states of arousal and attention. Our results may therefore be relevant to the neurobiological mechanism of attention.},

For cells with central-parafoveal receptive fields, attention reduced spatial integration, as demonstrated by a reduction in preferred stimulus length and in the size of the spatial summation area. Conversely, in cells that represented more peripheral locations, attention increased spatial integration by increasing the cell's summation area.

Surprisingly, just after eye opening nearly all orientation-selective neurons were also direction selective. During later development, the number of neurons responding to drifting gratings increased in parallel with the fraction of neurons that were orientation, but not direction, selective. Our experiments demonstrate that direction selectivity develops normally in dark-reared mice, indicating that the early development of direction selectivity is independent of visual experience. Furthermore, remarkable functional similarities exist between the development of direction selectivity in cortical neurons and the previously reported development of direction selectivity in the mouse retina. Together, these findings provide strong evidence that the development of orientation and direction selectivity in the mouse brain is distinctly different from that in ferrets.},

abstract = {Our visual system imposes structure onto images that usually contain a diversity of surfaces, contours, and colors. Psychological theories propose that there are multiple steps in this process that occur in hierarchically organized regions of the cortex: early visual areas register basic features, higher areas bind them into objects, and yet higher areas select the objects that are relevant for behavior. Here we test these theories by recording from the primary visual cortex (area V1) of monkeys. We demonstrate that the V1 neurons first register the features (at a latency of 48 ms), then segregate figures from the background (after 57 ms), and finally select relevant figures over irrelevant ones (after 137 ms). We conclude that the psychological processing stages map onto distinct time episodes that unfold in the visual cortex after the presentation of a new stimulus, so that area V1 may contribute to all these processing steps.},

abstract = {Animal learning is associated with changes in the efficacy of connections between neurons. The rules that govern this plasticity can be tested in neural networks. Rules that train neural networks to map stimuli onto outputs are given by supervised learning and reinforcement learning theories. Supervised learning is efficient but biologically implausible. In contrast, reinforcement learning is biologically plausible but comparatively inefficient. It lacks a mechanism that can identify units at early processing levels that play a decisive role in the stimulus-response mapping. Here we show that this so-called credit assignment problem can be solved by a new role for attention in learning. There are two factors in our new learning scheme that determine synaptic plasticity: (1) a reinforcement signal that is homogeneous across the network and depends on the amount of reward obtained after a trial, and (2) an attentional feedback signal from the output layer that limits plasticity to those units at earlier processing levels that are crucial for the stimulus-response mapping. The new scheme is called attention-gated reinforcement learning (AGREL). We show that it is as efficient as supervised learning in classification tasks. AGREL is biologically realistic and integrates the role of feedback connections, attention effects, synaptic plasticity, and reinforcement learning signals into a coherent framework.},

abstract = {The contribution and precise role of intracortical circuits in generating orientation tuned responses in visual cortical neurons is still controversial. To address this question, the relationship between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections and orientation maps in ferret striate cortex was investigated by combining in vivo optical imaging and in vitro scanning laser photostimulation. Excitatory and inhibitory inputs to pyramidal cells originated preferentially from regions with similar orientation preference. Prominent cross-orientation inhibition was not observed, arguing against cross-orientation models of orientation selectivity. The tuning of inhibitory inputs was significantly broader in both layer 2/3 and layer 5/6 pyramidal neurons compared to the tuning of excitatory inputs. Local excitatory inputs were more prominent in the 0-20 degrees tuning difference range between pre- and postsynaptic cells than inhibitory inputs, whereas inhibition dominated in the 20-40 degrees tuning difference range. These differences in tuning of excitatory and inhibitory inputs onto individual cells are consistent with the predictions of recurrent models of orientation selectivity.},

abstract = {Our goal was to understand how patterns of excitation and inhibition, interacting across arrays of ganglion cells in space and time, generate the spiking output pattern for each ganglion cell type. We presented the retina with a 1-s flashed square, 600 microm on a side, and measured patterns of excitation and inhibition over an 1,800-microm-wide region encompassing many ganglion cells. Excitatory patterns of on ganglion cells resembled rectified versions of the voltage patterns of on bipolar cells. Inhibitory patterns in on ganglion cells resembled the rectified versions of voltage patterns of off bipolar cells. off ganglion cells received off excitation and on inhibition. Many ganglion cells also received an additional wide field transient inhibition derived from the activity of both on and off bipolar cells. Ganglion cell spiking was suppressed in those space-time regions dominated by inhibition. We classified each ganglion cell type by correlating its space-time patterns with its dendritic morphology. These studies suggest the bipolar and amacrine cell circuitry underlying the interplay between on and off signals that generate spiking patterns in ganglion cells. They reveal a surprising synergistic interaction between excitation and inhibition in most ganglion cells.},

Not only has scaling been found in different visual environments, but the phenomenon also appears to be calibration-independent. This paper proposes a simple property of natural images which explains this robustness: they are collages of regions corresponding to statistically independent "objects". Evidence is provided for these objects having a power-law distribution of sizes within images, from which follows scaling in natural images. It is commonly suggested that scaling instead results from edges, each with power spectrum 1/k2. This hypothesis is refuted by example.},

Here we show, by introducing a histidine-to-arginine point mutation at position 101 of the murine alpha1-subunit gene, that alpha1-type GABA(A) receptors, which are mainly expressed in cortical areas and thalamus, are rendered insensitive to allosteric modulation by benzodiazepine-site ligands, whilst regulation by the physiological neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid is preserved. alpha1(H101R) mice failed to show the sedative, amnesic and partly the anticonvulsant action of diazepam. In contrast, the anxiolytic-like, myorelaxant, motor-impairing and ethanol-potentiating effects were fully retained, and are attributed to the nonmutated GABA(A) receptors found in the limbic system (alpha2, alpha5), in monoaminergic neurons (alpha3) and in motoneurons (alpha2, alpha5). Thus, benzodiazepine-induced behavioural responses are mediated by specific GABA(A) receptor subtypes in distinct neuronal circuits, which is of interest for drug design.},

Recent data suggest that neurons expressing three markers, the Ca2+-binding protein parvalbumin (PV), the neuropeptide somatostatin (SST), and the ionotropic serotonin receptor 5HT3a (5HT3aR) account for nearly 100\% of neocortical interneurons. Interneurons expressing each of these markers have a different embryological origin. Each group includes several types of interneurons that differ in morphological and electrophysiological properties and likely have different functions in the cortical circuit. The PV group accounts for ∼40\% of GABAergic neurons and includes fast spiking basket cells and chandelier cells. The SST group, which represents ∼30\% of GABAergic neurons, includes the Martinotti cells and a set of neurons that specifically target layerIV. The 5HT3aR group, which also accounts for ∼30\% of the total interneuronal population, is heterogeneous and includes all of the neurons that express the neuropeptide VIP, as well as an equally numerous subgroup of neurons that do not express VIP and includes neurogliaform cells. The universal modulation of these neurons by serotonin and acetylcholine via ionotropic receptors suggests that they might be involved in shaping cortical circuits during specific brain states and behavioral contexts.},

This diversity suggests that individual inhibitory classes have unique roles in cortical circuits; however, their characterization to date has been limited to broad classifications including many subtypes. We used the Cre/LoxP system, specifically labeling parvalbumin(PV)-expressing interneurons in visual cortex of PV-Cre mice with red fluorescent protein (RFP), followed by targeted loose-patch recordings and two-photon imaging of calcium responses in vivo to characterize the visual receptive field properties of these cells. Despite their relative molecular and morphological homogeneity, we find that PV+ neurons have a diversity of feature-specific visual responses that include sharp orientation and direction-selectivity, small receptive fields, and band-pass spatial frequency tuning. These results suggest that subsets of parvalbumin interneurons are components of specific cortical networks and that perisomatic inhibition contributes to the generation of precise response properties.},

Still, how the properties of specific inhibitory neuron classes relate to their local circuits remains unclear. To better understand the distribution and origins of orientation selectivity in inhibitory neurons expressing the calcium binding protein parvalbumin (PV) in the mouse primary visual cortex, we labeled PV(+) neurons with red fluorescent protein (RFP) and targeted them for cell-attached electrophysiological recordings. PV(+) neurons could be broadly tuned or sharply tuned for orientation but tended to be more broadly tuned than unlabeled neurons on average. The dendritic morphology of PV(+) cells, revealed by intracellular labeling, was strongly correlated with tuning: highly tuned PV(+) neurons had shorter dendrites that branched nearer to the soma and had smaller dendritic fields overall, whereas broadly tuned PV(+) neurons had longer dendrites that branched farther from the soma, producing larger dendritic fields. High-speed two-photon calcium imaging of visual responses showed that the orientation preferences of highly tuned PV(+) neurons resembled the preferred orientations of neighboring cells. These results suggest that the diversity of the local neighborhood and the nature of dendritic sampling may both contribute to the response selectivity of PV(+) neurons.},

We fit this cascade model to responses of individual MT neurons and show that it robustly predicts the separately measured responses to gratings and plaids. The model captures the full range of pattern motion selectivity found in MT. Cells that signal pattern motion are distinguished by having convergent excitatory input from V1 cells with a wide range of preferred directions, strong motion opponent suppression and a tuned normalization that may reflect suppressive input from the surround of V1 cells.},

The maturation of orientation selectivity in ferret area 17 has been demonstrated previously by quantitative single-unit recording and optical imaging to begin at approximately postnatal days (P) 32-P36. We therefore made restricted injections of cholera toxin B-subunit (CTB) or CTB-gold into ferret area 17 at a series of developmental ages and statistically quantified the degree of clustering in plots of retrogradely labeled cells in tangential sections through layer III for comparison to the published values for orientation tuning at each age. At P21, horizontal connections within area 17 lacked patchiness entirely, although clear patches of labeled cells were present in extrastriate areas. By P27, significant clustering of horizontal connections within area 17 was present. A second phase of cluster refinement was observed to occur at approximately P34-P36, coinciding with the emergence of mature orientation tuning and maps. Continuous silencing of cortical action potentials by chronic tetrodotoxin infusion from P21 resulted in a spatially random distribution of retrogradely labeled cells at P34. In contrast, bilateral enucleation from P21 did not prevent the initial development of clustered horizontal connections. We conclude, based on our findings and those of others, that the anatomical specificity of long-range horizontal connections results from an activity-dependent process that initially can use spontaneous activity in the cortical and thalamic networks to establish crude periodic connections and later uses visual cues to refine these connections.},

abstract = {Neurophysiological studies demonstrated that increases in cholinergic transmission in sensory areas enhance the cortical processing of thalamic inputs. Cholinergic activity also suppresses the retrieval of internal associations, thereby further promoting sensory input processing. Behavioral studies documented the role of cortical cholinergic inputs in attentional functions and capacities by demonstrating, for example, that the integrity of the cortical cholinergic input system is necessary for attentional performance, and that the activity of cortical cholinergic inputs is selectively enhanced during attentional performance. This review aims at integrating the neurophysiological and behavioral evidence on the functions of cortical cholinergic inputs and hypothesizes that the cortical cholinergic input system generally acts to optimize the processing of signals in attention-demanding contexts. Such signals 'recruit', via activation of basal forebrain corticopetal cholinergic projections, the cortical attention systems and thereby amplify the processing of attention-demanding signals (termed 'signal-driven cholinergic modulation of detection'). The activity of corticopetal cholinergic projections is also modulated by direct prefrontal projections to the basal forebrain and, indirectly, to cholinergic terminals elsewhere in the cortex; thus, cortical cholinergic inputs are also involved in the mediation of top-down effects, such as the knowledge-based augmentation of detection (see Footnote 1) of signals and the filtering of irrelevant information (termed 'cognitive cholinergic modulation of detection'). Thus, depending on the quality of signals and task characteristics, cortical cholinergic activity reflects the combined effects of signal-driven and cognitive modulation of detection. This hypothesis begins to explain signal intensity or duration-dependent performance in attention tasks, the distinct effects of cortex-wide versus prefrontal cholinergic deafferentation on attention performance, and it generates specific predictions concerning cortical acetylcholine (ACh) release in attention task-performing animals. Finally, the consequences of abnormalities in the regulation of cortical cholinergic inputs for the manifestation of the symptoms of major neuropsychiatric disorders are conceptualized in terms of dysregulation in the signal-driven and cognitive cholinergic modulation of detection processes.},

abstract = {The identification and characterization of drugs for the treatment of cognitive disorders has been hampered by the absence of comprehensive hypotheses. Such hypotheses consist of (a) a precisely defined cognitive operation that fundamentally underlies a range of cognitive abilities and capacities and, if impaired, contributes to the manifestation of diverse cognitive symptoms; (b) defined neuronal mechanisms proposed to mediate the cognitive operation of interest; (c) evidence indicating that the putative cognition enhancer facilitates these neuronal mechanisms; (d) and evidence indicating that the cognition enhancer facilitates cognitive performance by modulating these underlying neuronal mechanisms. The evidence on the neuronal and attentional effects of nAChR agonists, specifically agonists selective for alpha4beta2* nAChRs, has begun to support such a hypothesis. nAChR agonists facilitate the detection of signals by augmenting the transient increases in prefrontal cholinergic activity that are necessary for a signal to gain control over behavior in attentional contexts. The prefrontal microcircuitry mediating these effects include alpha4beta2* nAChRs situated on the terminals of thalamic inputs and the glutamatergic stimulation of cholinergic terminals via ionotropic glutamate receptors. Collectively, this evidence forms the basis for hypothesis-guided development and characterization of cognition enhancers.},

abstract = {1. Effects of blocking intracortical inhibition by microiontophoretic administration of bicuculline methiodide (BMI), a selective antagonist for GABAA receptors, on orientation selectivity of 109 neurones were studied in the primary visual cortex (V1) of anaesthetized and paralysed monkeys. 2. The averaged orientation tuning of visual responses of cells was poor in cytochrome oxidaserich blobs of layer II/III and in layer IVc beta, moderate in layers IVb, IVc alpha and V, and sharp in the interblob region of layer II/III and in layers IVa and VI. 3. Iontophoretic administration of BMI reduced the sharpness of orientation tuning of cells to a varying extent in each layer. In most cells, furthermore, the originally ineffective stimuli induced visual responses during the BMI administration, suggesting that excitatory inputs evoked by the non-optimally oriented stimuli were masked by GABAergic inhibition. Nevertheless, the maximal facilitation was observed in the response to the optimally or near-optimally oriented stimuli. 4. There was a difference in such an effect of BMI among layers. Orientation selectivity of cells in interblobs in layer II/III and in layer IVb was sensitive to BMI whereas that of cells in layer VI was relatively insensitive to BMI, suggesting a larger contribution of excitatory mechanisms to the orientation selectivity in this layer. 5. In the orientation-selective cells, an analysis of the magnitude of excitation and inhibition evoked by stimuli at various orientations suggests that both inputs tune around the optimal orientation and their magnitudes are almost proportional to each other except at the optimal orientation. This analysis also indicates that the orientation tuning of inhibition had a less prominent peak around the optimal orientation than that of excitation. This dominance of excitation over inhibition around the optimal orientation may function to accentuate the response to the optimally oriented stimulus. 6. These results suggest that, in the monkey V1, the orientation selectivity of cells is largely dependent on the orientation-biased excitatory and inhibitory inputs which have a broader tuning profile, covering from the optimal to null-orientation, than that observed in extracellularly recorded responses at the control level.},

A number of areas exhibited retinotopic activations, including full or partial visual field representations in occipital cortex, the precuneus, motion-sensitive temporal cortex (extending into the superior temporal sulcus), the intraparietal sulcus, and the vicinity of the frontal eye fields in frontal cortex. Early visual areas showed mainly stimulus-driven retinotopy; parietal and frontal areas were driven primarily by attention; and lateral temporal regions could be driven by both. We found clear spatial specificity of attentional modulation not just in early visual areas but also in classical attentional control areas in parietal and frontal cortex. Indeed, strong spatiotopic activity in these areas could be evoked by directed attention alone. Conversely, motion-sensitive temporal regions, while exhibiting attentional modulation, also responded significantly when attention was directed away from the retinotopic stimuli.},

abstract = {The spatial summation properties of visual signals were analyzed for geniculocortical afferents in the primary visual cortex (V1) of anesthetized paralyzed macaque monkeys. Afferent input responses were recorded extracellularly during cortical inactivation through superfusion of the cortex with muscimol, allowing investigation of lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (LGN) cell properties in the absence of cortical feedback. Responses from afferent inputs were classified as magno-, parvo-, or koniocellular based on anatomical organization within the cortex, established through histological reconstructions, and visual response wavelength sensitivity. More than 80\% of afferents showed strong surround suppression [suppression index (SI) >0.5] and 14\% showed negligible surround suppression (SI < 0.2). Afferent responses with weak and strong surround suppression were found throughout cortical input layers 4C and 4A. High-contrast estimates of the spatial extent of the classical surround were similar to the nonclassical surround. The classical and nonclassical surrounds were, on average, 1.5-fold larger than the excitatory center. Unlike neurons within V1, the spatial extent of excitatory summation for geniculocortical afferents was contrast invariant. Nonclassical surround suppression showed slight contrast dependency with estimates larger (20\%) at lower contrasts and stronger at higher contrasts (13\%). Surround suppression is inherent in cortical input responses and likely derives from lateral inhibition in either the LGN or retina. Although surround suppression within afferent responses increases slightly with contrast, the spatial spread of excitation remains fixed with contrast. This argues for distinct mechanisms of action for contrast-dependent modulation in cortical and subcortical responses.},

The behavioural aspects of such perceptual learning are well documented, especially in the visual system. Specificity for stimulus attributes clearly implicates an early cortical site, where receptive fields retain fine selectivity for these attributes; however, the neuronal correlates of a simple visual discrimination task remained unidentified. Here we report electrophysiological correlates in the primary visual cortex (V1) of monkeys for learning orientation identification. We link the behavioural improvement in this type of learning to an improved neuronal performance of trained compared to naive neurons. Improved long-term neuronal performance resulted from changes in the characteristics of orientation tuning of individual neurons. More particularly, the slope of the orientation tuning curve that was measured at the trained orientation increased only for the subgroup of trained neurons most likely to code the orientation identified by the monkey. No modifications of the tuning curve were observed for orientations for which the monkey had not been trained. Thus training induces a specific and efficient increase in neuronal sensitivity in V1.},

abstract = {The responses of neurons in sensory cortices are affected by the spatial context within which stimuli are embedded. In the primary visual cortex (V1), orientation-selective responses to stimuli in the receptive field (RF) center are suppressed by similarly oriented stimuli in the RF surround. Surround suppression, a likely neural correlate of perceptual figure-ground segregation, is traditionally thought to be generated within V1 by long-range horizontal connections. Recently however, it has been shown that these connections are too short and too slow to mediate fast suppression from distant regions of the RF surround. We use an anatomically and physiologically constrained recurrent network model of macaque V1 to show how interareal feedback connections, which are faster and longer-range than horizontal connections, can generate "far" surround suppression. We provide a novel solution to the puzzle of how surround suppression can arise from excitatory feedback axons contacting predominantly excitatory neurons in V1. The basic mechanism involves divergent feedback connections from the far surround targeting pyramidal neurons sending monosynaptic horizontal connections to excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the RF center. One of several predictions of our model is that the "suppressive far surround" is not always suppressive, but can facilitate the response of the RF center, depending on the amount of excitatory drive to the local inhibitors. Our model provides a general mechanism of how top-down feedback signals directly contribute to generating cortical neuron responses to simple sensory stimuli.},

abstract = {In this review, we summarize recent evidence that perceptual learning can occur not only under training conditions but also in situations of unattended and passive sensory stimulation. We suggest that the key to learning is to boost stimulus-related activity that is normally insufficient exceed a learning threshold. We discuss how factors such as attention and reinforcement have crucial, permissive roles in learning. We observe, however, that highly optimized stimulation protocols can also boost responses and promote learning. This helps to reconcile observations of how learning can occur (or fail to occur) in seemingly contradictory circumstances, and argues that different processes that affect learning operate through similar mechanisms that are probably based on, and mediated by, neuromodulatory factors.},

abstract = {Perceptual learning in adult humans and animals refers to improvements in sensory abilities after training. These improvements had been thought to occur only when attention is focused on the stimuli to be learned (task-relevant learning) but recent studies demonstrate performance improvements outside the focus of attention (task-irrelevant learning). Here, we propose a unified model that explains both task-relevant and task-irrelevant learning. The model suggests that long-term sensitivity enhancements to task-relevant or irrelevant stimuli occur as a result of timely interactions between diffused signals triggered by task performance and signals produced by stimulus presentation. The proposed mechanism uses multiple attentional and reinforcement systems that rely on different underlying neuromodulators. Our model provides insights into how neural modulators, attentional and reinforcement learning systems are related.},

abstract = {Neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) receive feedforward input from the thalamus, which shapes receptive-field properties. They additionally receive recurrent inputs via horizontal connections within V1 and feedback from higher visual areas that are thought to be important for conscious visual perception. Here, we investigated what roles different glutamate receptors play in conveying feedforward and recurrent inputs in macaque V1. As a measure of recurrent processing, we used figure-ground modulation (FGM), the increased activity of neurons representing figures compared with background, which depends on feedback from higher areas. We found that feedforward-driven activity was strongly reduced by the AMPA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), whereas this drug had no effect on FGM. In contrast, blockers of the NMDA receptor reduced FGM, whereas their effect on visually driven activity varied with the subunit specificity of the drug. The NMDA receptor blocker 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV) caused a slight reduction of the visual response, whereas ifenprodil, which targets NMDA receptors containing the NMDA receptor NR2B subunit, increased the visual response. These findings demonstrate that glutamate receptors contribute differently to feedforward and recurrent processing in V1 and suggest ways to selectively disrupt recurrent processing so that its role in visual perception can be elucidated.},

abstract = {Theoretical considerations have led to the concept that the cerebral cortex is operating in a balanced state in which synaptic excitation is approximately balanced by synaptic inhibition from the local cortical circuit. This paper is about the functional consequences of the balanced state in sensory cortex. One consequence is gain control: there is experimental evidence and theoretical support for the idea that local circuit inhibition acts as a local automatic gain control throughout the cortex. Second, inhibition increases cortical feature selectivity: many studies of different sensory cortical areas have reported that suppressive mechanisms contribute to feature selectivity. Synaptic inhibition from the local microcircuit should be untuned (or broadly tuned) for stimulus features because of the microarchitecture of the cortical microcircuit. Untuned inhibition probably is the source of Untuned Suppression that enhances feature selectivity. We studied inhibition's function in our experiments, guided by a neuronal network model, on orientation selectivity in the primary visual cortex, V1, of the Macaque monkey. Our results revealed that Untuned Suppression, generated by local circuit inhibition, is crucial for the generation of highly orientation-selective cells in V1 cortex.},

abstract = {The lateral geniculate nucleus is the best understood thalamic relay and serves as a model for all thalamic relays. Only 5-10\% of the input to geniculate relay cells derives from the retina, which is the driving input. The rest is modulatory and derives from local inhibitory inputs, descending inputs from layer 6 of the visual cortex, and ascending inputs from the brainstem. These modulatory inputs control many features of retinogeniculate transmission. One such feature is the response mode, burst or tonic, of relay cells, which relates to the attentional demands at the moment. This response mode depends on membrane potential, which is controlled effectively by the modulator inputs. The lateral geniculate nucleus is a first-order relay, because it relays subcortical (i.e. retinal) information to the cortex for the first time. By contrast, the other main thalamic relay of visual information, the pulvinar region, is largely a higher-order relay, since much of it relays information from layer 5 of one cortical area to another. All thalamic relays receive a layer-6 modulatory input from cortex, but higher-order relays in addition receive a layer-5 driver input. Corticocortical processing may involve these corticothalamocortical 're-entry' routes to a far greater extent than previously appreciated. If so, the thalamus sits at an indispensable position for the modulation of messages involved in corticocortical processing.},

abstract = {Many neurons (56/174, or 32.2\%) studied in the cat striate cortex (area 17) increased significantly (by 3.3 times on average) their responses under stimulation by cruciform or corner figures of specific or non-specific shape and orientation flashing in receptive field as compared with single light bar of preferred orientation. Most of these neurons (71.4\%) were found to be highly selective to both the shape (the angle between the figure's lines) and orientation of these figures. In the neuronal selection studied we have also found all possible types of invariance of the cross and corner tuning to orientation and/or shape of these figures. We found neurons with selectivity to the form of the figures and invariance to their orientation and, on the contrary, units invariant to shape but selective to orientation. Some cells were found invariant to both the form and orientation of the cruciform or corner figure but highly sensitive to appearance of any such figure in the receptive field. Two main hypotheses about the mechanisms of selective sensitivity to crosses and angles can be considered. They are as follows: an excitatory convergence of two units with different preferred orientations, and intracortical inhibitory interactions. The cells with double orientation tuning for a single bar are found relatively rarely (about 20\%), thus making the first suggestion the most unlikely. This circumstance is of special importance since it provides evidence against the hierarchic formation of the higher-order cortical units from a set of lower-order cells that is still under discussion. The units with high sensitivity to cross or corner seem to be ideally suitable for their selection, rather than to serve as classical orientation detectors only.},

Taking focal visual attention as an example, recent anatomical findings suggest that the pulvinar might act as a remote hub for coordinating spatial activity within multiple cortical visual maps. The pulvinar can, in turn, be influenced by signals originating in the frontal and parietal eye fields, using common visuomotor neural circuitry, with the superior colliculus acting as an important link. By identifying a complex, real neural architecture ('RNA') model for attention, it is possible to integrate several different modes of operation - such as parallel or serial, bottom-up or top-down, preattentive or attentive - that characterize conflicting cognitive models of attention in visual search paradigms.},

This study was aimed at revealing possible organizational relationships between the feedback projections from area V2 and the functional maps of orientation and retinotopy in area V1. Optical imaging of intrinsic signals was combined with cytochrome oxidase histochemistry and connectional anatomy in owl monkeys. Tracer injections were administered at orientation-selective domains in regions of pale and thick cytochrome oxidase stripes adjacent to the border between these stripes. The feedback projections from V2 were found to be more diffuse than the intrinsic horizontal connections within V1, but they nevertheless demonstrated clustering. The clusters of feedback axons projected preferentially to interblob cytochrome oxidase regions. The distribution of preferred orientations of the recipient domains in V1 was broad but appeared biased toward values similar to the preferred orientation of the projecting cells in V2. The global spatial distribution of the feedback projections in V1 was anisotropic. The major axis of anisotropy was systematically parallel to a retinotopic axis in V1 corresponding to the preferred orientation of the cells of origin in V2. We conclude that the feedback connections from V2 to V1 might play a role in enhancing the response in V1 to collinear contour elements.},

abstract = {In visual cortex, responses to stimulation of the receptive field (RF) are modulated by simultaneous stimulation of the RF surround. The mechanisms for surround modulation remain unidentified. We previously proposed that in the primary visual cortex (V1), near surround modulation is mediated by geniculocortical and horizontal connections and far surround modulation by interareal feedback connections. To understand spatial integration in the secondary visual cortex (V2) and its underlying circuitry, we have characterized spatial summation in different V2 layers and stripe compartments and compared it to that in V1. We used grating stimuli in circular and annular apertures of different sizes to estimate the extent and sensitivity of RF and surround components in V1 and V2. V2 RFs and surrounds were twice as large as those in V1. As in V1, V2 RFs doubled in size when measured at low contrast. In both V1 and V2, surrounds were about fivefold the size of the RF and the far surround could exceed 12.5 degrees in radius, averaging 5.5 degrees in V1 and 9.2 degrees in V2. The strength of surround suppression was similar in both areas. Thus although differing in spatial scale, the interactions among RF components are similar in V1 and V2, suggesting similar underlying mechanisms. As in V1, the extent of V2 horizontal connections matches that of the RF center, but is much smaller than the largest far surrounds, which likely derive from interareal feedback. In V2, we found no laminar or stripe differences in size and magnitude of surround suppression, suggesting conservation across stripes of the basic circuit for surround modulation.},

abstract = {In macaque primary visual cortex (V1), neuronal responses to stimuli inside the receptive field (RF) are modulated by stimuli in the RF surround. This modulation is orientation specific. Previous studies suggested that, for some cells, this specificity may not be fixed but changes with the stimulus orientation presented to the RF. We demonstrate, in recording studies, that this tuning behavior is instead highly prevalent in V1 and, in theoretical work, that it arises only if V1 operates in a regime of strong local recurrence. Strongest surround suppression occurs when the stimuli in the RF and the surround are iso-oriented, and strongest facilitation when the stimuli are cross-oriented. This is the case even when the RF is suboptimally activated by a stimulus of nonpreferred orientation but only if this stimulus can activate the cell when presented alone. This tuning behavior emerges from the interaction of lateral inhibition (via the surround pathways), which is tuned to the preferred orientation of the RF, with weakly tuned, but strong, local recurrent connections, causing maximal withdrawal of recurrent excitation at the feedforward input orientation. Thus, horizontal and feedback modulation of strong recurrent circuits allows the tuning of contextual effects to change with changing feedforward inputs.},

abstract = {In primary visual cortex (V1), neuronal responses to stimuli inside the receptive field (RF) are usually suppressed by stimuli in the RF surround. This suppression is orientation specific. Similarly, in human vision surround stimuli can suppress perceived contrast of a central stimulus in an orientation-dependent manner. The surround consists of two regions likely generated by different circuits: a near-surround generated predominantly by geniculocortical and intra-V1 horizontal connections, and a far-surround generated exclusively by interareal feedback. Using stimuli confined to the near- or far-surround of V1 neurons, and similar stimuli in human psychophysics, we find that near-surround suppression is more sharply orientation tuned than far-surround suppression in both macaque V1 and human perception. These results point to a similarity between surround suppression in macaque V1 and human vision, and suggest that feedback circuits are less orientation biased than horizontal circuits. We find the sharpest tuning of near-surround suppression in V1 layers (3, 4B, 4C$\alpha$) with patterned and orientation-specific horizontal connections. Sharpest tuning of far-surround suppression occurs in layer 4B, suggesting greater orientation specificity of feedback to this layer. Different orientation tuning of near- and far-surround suppression may reflect a statistical bias in natural images, whereby nearby edges have higher probability than distant edges of being co-oriented and belonging to the same contour. Surround suppression would, thus, increase the coding efficiency of frequently co-occurring contours and the saliency of less frequent ones. Such saliency increase can help detect small orientation differences in nearby edges (for contour completion), but large orientation differences in distant edges (for directing saccades/attention).},

abstract = {Reliable activation of inhibitory pathways is essential for maintaining the balance between excitation and inhibition during cortical activity. Little is known, however, about the activation of these pathways at the level of the local neocortical microcircuit. We report a disynaptic inhibitory pathway among neocortical pyramidal cells (PCs). Inhibitory responses were evoked in layer 5 PCs following stimulation of individual neighboring PCs with trains of action potentials. The probability for inhibition between PCs was more than twice that of direct excitation, and inhibitory responses increased as a function of rate and duration of presynaptic discharge. Simultaneous somatic and dendritic recordings indicated that inhibition originated from PC apical and tuft dendrites. Multineuron whole-cell recordings from PCs and interneurons combined with morphological reconstructions revealed the mediating interneurons as Martinotti cells. Martinotti cells received facilitating synapses from PCs and formed reliable inhibitory synapses onto dendrites of neighboring PCs. We describe this feedback pathway and propose it as a central mechanism for regulation of cortical activity.},

abstract = {Feedback projections are an integral part of the mammalian visual system. Although it is tempting to relegate them to a subsidiary role in visual processing, because their supposed latency and lag might appear to be unfavourable for an involvement in fast processing, this is a dangerous simplification. Certainly for the world in motion, feedback from higher motion areas can influence the transfer of ascending input when, or even before, the input arrives. Here, we consider the circuit formed by layer 6 feedback cells in the visual cortex and how this straddles the retinothalamic and thalamocortical transfer of visual input. We discuss its links to feedback from the cortical motion area MT (V5), and suggest that motion perception involves a dynamic interplay between MT, V1 and the thalamus.

abstract = {One important aspect of the functional architecture of primary visual cortex is the circuitry that accounts for the receptive field properties of neurons. The anatomy that underlies retinotopy and ocular dominance is well known, but no anatomical structure related to orientation selectivity has been found in primates. We examined whether the arrangement of local axon systems projecting within the cortical layers might be correlated with orientation preference in New World monkeys. We found that axons in layer 3 spread out from the site of a tracer injection in an anisotropic manner and that this elongated distribution is aligned with the preferred orientation recorded at each site. Moreover, within a few degrees of the foveal representation, the majority of the axon terminals fall within or just outside of the limits of the cortical mapping of the classical receptive field. Thus local axons produce a field of monosynaptic excitation that aligns with orientation axes and reaches neurons that have receptive fields which are adjacent in visual space.},

abstract = {Primary and secondary visual cortex (V1 and V2) form the foundation of the cortical visual system. V1 transforms information received from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and distributes it to separate domains in V2 for transmission to higher visual areas. During the past 20 years, schemes for the functional organization of V1 and V2 have been based on a tripartite framework developed by Livingstone \& Hubel (1988) . Since then, new anatomical data have accumulated concerning V1's input, its internal circuitry, and its output to V2. These new data, along with physiological and imaging studies, now make it likely that the visual attributes of color, form, and motion are not neatly segregated by V1 into different stripe compartments in V2. Instead, there are just two main streams, originating from cytochrome oxidase patches and interpatches, that project to V2. Each stream is composed of a mixture of magno, parvo, and konio geniculate signals. Further studies are required to elucidate how the patches and interpatches differ in the output they convey to extrastriate cortex.},

Receptive field subregions were often precisely shared among neighboring neurons. Furthermore, large subregions seem to be assembled from multiple smaller, non-overlapping subregions of other neurons in the same local population. These experiments provide, to our knowledge, the first characterization of the diversity of receptive fields in a dense local network of visual cortex and reveal elementary units of receptive field organization. Our results suggest that a limited pool of afferent receptive fields is available to a local population of neurons and reveal new organizational principles for the neural circuitry of the mouse visual cortex.},

abstract = {Neuronal dendrites are electrically excitable: they can generate regenerative events such as dendritic spikes in response to sufficiently strong synaptic input. Although such events have been observed in many neuronal types, it is not well understood how active dendrites contribute to the tuning of neuronal output in vivo. Here we show that dendritic spikes increase the selectivity of neuronal responses to the orientation of a visual stimulus (orientation tuning). We performed direct patch-clamp recordings from the dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the primary visual cortex of lightly anaesthetized and awake mice, during sensory processing. Visual stimulation triggered regenerative local dendritic spikes that were distinct from back-propagating action potentials. These events were orientation tuned and were suppressed by either hyperpolarization of membrane potential or intracellular blockade of NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptors. Both of these manipulations also decreased the selectivity of subthreshold orientation tuning measured at the soma, thus linking dendritic regenerative events to somatic orientation tuning. Together, our results suggest that dendritic spikes that are triggered by visual input contribute to a fundamental cortical computation: enhancing orientation selectivity in the visual cortex. Thus, dendritic excitability is an essential component of behaviourally relevant computations in neurons.},

Physiological studies have confirmed the existence of three classes of cone photoreceptors, and of colour-opponent neurons that compare the signals from cones, but modern work has drawn attention to unexpected complexities of early organization: the proportions of cones of different types vary widely among individuals, without great effect on colour vision; the arrangement of different types of cones in the mosaic seems to be random, making it hard to optimize the connections to colour-opponent mechanisms; and new forms of colour-opponent mechanisms have recently been discovered. At a higher level, in the primary visual cortex, recent studies have revealed a simpler organization than had earlier been supposed, and in some respects have made it easier to reconcile physiological and perceptual findings.},

abstract = {Although the response of a neuron in the visual cortex generally grows nonlinearly with contrast, the spatial tuning of the cell remains stable. This is thought to reflect the activity of a contrast gain control ("normalization") that has very broad tuning on the relevant stimulus dimension. Contrast invariant tuning on a particular dimension is probably necessary for reliable representation of stimuli on that dimension. In the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), V1, and V2 of anesthetized macaque, we measured chromatic tuning of neurons at several contrasts to characterize the gain controls and identify cells that might be important for representing color. We estimated separately the chromatic signature of the linear receptive field and that of the gain control. In the LGN, we found normalization in magnocellular cells and cells receiving excitatory S-cone input but not in parvocellular cells or those receiving inhibitory S-cone input. We found normalization in all types of cortical neurons. Among cells that preferred achromatic modulation, or modulation along intermediate directions in color space (making them responsive to both achromatic and chromatic stimuli), normalization was driven by mechanisms tuned to a restricted range of directions in color space, close to achromatic. As a result, chromatic tuning varied with contrast. Among the relatively few cells that strongly preferred chromatic modulation, normalization was driven by mechanisms sensitive to modulation along all directions in color space, especially isoluminant. As a result, chromatic tuning changed little with contrast. To the extent that contrast invariant tuning is important in representing chromaticity, relatively few cortical neurons are involved.},

abstract = {Descriptions of receptive fields at subcortical levels of the visual system have mostly considered only the classical receptive field (CRF). A suppressive extraclassical receptive field (ECRF) has been demonstrated in relay cells within the primate lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), but the quantitative properties and specific influence of the ECRF on the distinct magnocellular (MC), koniocellular (KC), and parvocellular (PC) pathways are not known. Here we quantified the effect of ECRF stimulation on visually responsive cells in the LGN of a diurnal New World primate, the marmoset. We show that for all cells, visually evoked responses are reduced by stimulation of the ECRF. The magnitude of the suppression is greatest for MC cells and smallest for PC cells. The effect of ECRF stimulation on KC cells is variable but always suppressive. We refer to these effects as extraclassical inhibition (ECI). The contrast-response relationship of the ECI parallels that of CRF-induced excitation for each cell class: for MC cells, ECI contrast threshold is close to 10\% and the ECI saturates at 50\% contrast, but the contrast dependence of ECI on PC cells is more linear. The ECI also contributes to contrast-dependent changes in spatial summation: on average for all LGN cells the radius of the excitatory spatial summation field (measured from aperture-tuning curves) at low contrast is 1.31 times that at high contrast. No consistent effects of orientation on ECI were seen. The data suggest that the suppressive component of the ECRF seen in cortical neurons could primarily be inherited from subcortical input streams.},

However, a number of issues regarding this modulation remain unknown, such as the effect and its function, and the receptor subtypes involved. To address these issues, we combined extracellular single-unit recordings and microiontophoretic administration of ACh, and measured V1 neuronal responses to drifting sinusoidal grating stimuli in anesthetized macaque monkeys. ACh was found to have mostly facilitatory effects on the visual responses, although some cases of suppressive effects were also seen. To assess the functional role of ACh, we further examined how ACh modulates the stimulus contrast-response function, finding that the response gain increased with the facilitatory effect. The response facilitation was completely or strongly blocked by atropine, a muscarinic ACh receptor (AChR) antagonist, in almost all neurons (96\% of cells), while any residual effect after atropine administration was fully removed by mecamylamine, a nicotinic AChR antagonist, suggesting a predominant role for muscarinic AChRs in this mechanism. Furthermore, we found no laminar distribution bias for the facilitatory modulation, although the relative contribution of muscarinic AChRs was smaller in layer 4C than in other layers. The suppressive effect was completely blocked by atropine. These results demonstrate that ACh plays an important role in visual information processing in V1 by controlling the response gain via muscarinic AChRs across all cortical layers and via nicotinic AChRs mainly in layer 4C.},

@article{Somers1998,
abstract = {Integration of inputs by cortical neurons provides the basis for the complex information processing performed in the cerebral cortex. Here, we have examined how primary visual cortical neurons integrate classical and nonclassical receptive field inputs. The effect of nonclassical receptive field stimuli and, correspondingly, of long-range intracortical inputs is known to be context-dependent: the same long-range stimulus can either facilitate or suppress responses, depending on the level of local activation. By constructing a large-scale model of primary visual cortex, we demonstrate that this effect can be understood in terms of the local cortical circuitry. Each receptive field position contributes both excitatory and inhibitory inputs; however, the inhibitory inputs have greater influence when overall receptive field drive is greater. This mechanism also explains contrast-dependent modulations within the classical receptive field, which similarly switch between excitatory and inhibitory. In order to simplify analysis and to explain the fundamental mechanisms of the model, self-contained modules that capture nonlinear local circuit interactions are constructed. This work supports the notion that receptive field integration is the result of local processing within small groups of neurons rather than in single neurons.},

abstract = {Neurons were studied in the striate cortex of the cat following intracellular recording and iontophoresis of horseradish peroxidase. The three selected neurons were identified as large basket cells on the basis that (i) the horizontal extent of their axonal arborization was three times or more than the extent of the dendritic arborization; (ii) some of their varicose terminal segments surrounded the perikarya of other neurons. The large elongated perikarya of the first two basket cells were located around the border of layers III and IV. The radially-elongated dendritic field, composed of beaded dendrites without spines, had a long axis of 300-350 microns, extending into layers III and IV, and a short axis of 200 microns. Only the axon, however, was recovered from the third basket cell. The lateral spread of the axons of the first two basket cells was 900 microns or more in layer III and, for the third cell, was over 1500 microns in the antero-posterior dimension, a value indicating that the latter neuron probably fulfills the first criterion above. The axon collaterals of all three cells often branched at approximately 90 degrees to the parent axon. The first two cells also had axon collaterals which descended to layers IV and V and had less extensive lateral spreads. The axons of all three cells formed clusters of boutons which could extend up a radial column of their target cells. Electron microscopic examination of the second basket cell showed a large lobulated nucleus and a high density of mitochondria in both the perikarya and dendrites. The soma and dendrites were densely covered by synaptic terminals. The axons of the second and third cells were myelinated up to the terminal segments. A total of 177 postsynaptic elements was analysed, involving 66 boutons of the second cell and 89 boutons of the third cell. The terminals contained pleomorphic vesicles and established symmetrical synapses with their postsynaptic targets. The basket cell axons formed synapses principally on pyramidal cell perikarya (approximately 33\% of synapses), spines (20\% of synapses) and the apical and basal dendrites of pyramidal cells (24\% of synapses). Also contacted were the perikarya and dendrites of non-pyramidal cells, an axon, and an axon initial segment. A single pyramidal cell may receive input on its soma, apical and basal dendrites and spines from the same large basket cell.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Improvements of visual hyperacuity are a key focus in research of perceptual learning. Of particular interest has been the specificity of visual hyperacuity learning to the particular features of the trained stimuli as well as disruption of learning that occurs in some cases when different stimulus features are trained together. The implications of these phenomena on the underlying learning mechanisms are still open to debate; however, there is a marked absence of computational models that explore these phenomena in a unified way. Here we implement a computational learning model based on reweighting and extend it to enable direct comparison, by means of simulations, with a variety of existing psychophysical data. We find that this very simple model can account for a diversity of findings, such as disruption of learning of one task by practice on a similar task, as well as transfer of learning across both tasks and stimulus configurations under certain conditions. These simulations help explain existing results in the literature as well as provide important insights and predictions regarding the reliability of different hyperacuity tasks and stimuli. Our simulations also shed light on the model's limitations, for example in accounting for temporal aspects of training procedures or dependency of learning with contextual stimuli, which will need to be addressed by future research.},

abstract = {Critical periods are times of pronounced brain plasticity. During a critical period in the postnatal development of the visual cortex, the occlusion of one eye triggers a rapid reorganization of neuronal responses, a process known as ocular dominance plasticity. We have shown that the transplantation of inhibitory neurons induces ocular dominance plasticity after the critical period. Transplanted inhibitory neurons receive excitatory synapses, make inhibitory synapses onto host cortical neurons, and promote plasticity when they reach a cellular age equivalent to that of endogenous inhibitory neurons during the normal critical period. These findings suggest that ocular dominance plasticity is regulated by the execution of a maturational program intrinsic to inhibitory neurons. By inducing plasticity, inhibitory neuron transplantation may facilitate brain repair.},

abstract = {1. Visual abilities decline during normal aging, and many of these declines are due to neural changes in the retina or central visual pathways. We have begun studies of the primate visual system to investigate the location and nature of these changes as well as to answer general questions about the effects of aging on neural function. We began with the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) because it is the main structure through which visual information passes on the way to cortex and because the parallel parvocellular and magnocellular pathways, which may be affected differently by aging, are anatomically distinct there. 2. Single-cell recordings were made in the LGN of young adult (5-16 yr) and old (25-28 yr) rhesus monkeys. We made quantitative measures of a wide variety of response properties for a large number of parvocellular (n = 257) and magnocellular (n = 113) neurons in the two groups of animals. As a result, in addition to studying the effects of aging, we were able to make quantitative comparisons between parvocellular and magnocellular neurons using larger samples than have been studied previously and for some properties that have not been studied before. 3. We found that magnocellular neurons have significantly higher maximal response rates and signal-to-noise ratios than parvocellular neurons. However, response latencies to visual stimulation were similar for neurons in the two types of layers. In agreement with previous studies, magnocellular neurons had higher maximal contrast sensitivity and higher contrast gain than parvocellular neurons. However, the sensitivity difference occurred because nearly all of the neurons with low sensitivities (< 10) were in the parvocellular layers, not because neurons in the magnocellular layers had the highest sensitivities. 4. Neurons with the smallest receptive-field centers, the highest spatial-frequency resolutions, and the highest optimal spatial frequencies were found in the parvocellular layers. However, the overall distributions of each of these properties overlapped substantially for neurons in the two types of layers, and the mean values were not significantly different. The mean high temporal-frequency cutoff was significantly higher for magnocellular than parvocellular neurons, but the difference was small (only 3 Hz), and it occurred because many parvocellular neurons had lower cutoffs than any seen in the magnocellular layers, not because magnocellular neurons had the highest temporal-frequency cutoffs. Parvocellular neurons also had narrower temporal-frequency tuning than magnocellular neurons. However, there was no significant difference in optimal temporal frequency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Time invariant description of synaptic connectivity in cortical circuits may be precluded by the ongoing growth and retraction of dendritic spines accompanied by the formation and elimination of synapses. On the other hand, the spatial arrangement of axonal and dendritic branches appears stable. This suggests that an invariant description of connectivity can be cast in terms of potential synapses, which are locations in the neuropil where an axon branch of one neuron is proximal to a dendritic branch of another neuron. In this paper, we attempt to reconstruct the potential connectivity in local cortical circuits of the cat primary visual cortex (V1). Based on multiple single-neuron reconstructions of axonal and dendritic arbors in 3 dimensions, we evaluate the expected number of potential synapses and the probability of potential connectivity among excitatory (pyramidal and spiny stellate) neurons and inhibitory basket cells. The results provide a quantitative description of structural organization of local cortical circuits. For excitatory neurons from different cortical layers, we compute local domains, which contain their potentially pre- and postsynaptic excitatory partners. These domains have columnar shapes with laminar specific radii and are roughly of the size of the ocular dominance column. Therefore, connections between most excitatory neurons in the ocular dominance column can be implemented by local synaptogenesis. Structural connectivity involving inhibitory basket cells is generally weaker than excitatory connectivity. Here, only nearby neurons are capable of establishing more than one potential synapse, implying that within the ocular dominance column these connections have more limited potential for circuit remodeling.},

To distinguish between these, we combined functional mapping with a new technique for labeling axons, a recombinant adenovirus bearing the gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP), to determine the extent, density, and orientation specificity of V1 intrinsic connections and V2 to V1 feedback. Both connections cover portions of V1 representing regions of visual space up to eight times larger than receptive fields as classically defined, though the intrinsic connections are an order of magnitude denser than the feedback. Whereas the intrinsic connections link similarly oriented domains in V1, V2 to V1 feedback displays no such specificity. These findings suggest that V1 intrinsic horizontal connections provide a more likely substrate for contour integration.},

abstract = {Development of orientation maps in ferret and cat primary visual cortex (V1) has been shown to be stable, in that the earliest measurable maps are similar in form to the eventual adult map, robust, in that similar maps develop in both dark rearing and in a variety of normal visual environments, and yet adaptive, in that the final map pattern reflects the statistics of the specific visual environment. How can these three properties be reconciled? Using mechanistic models of the development of neural connectivity in V1, we show for the first time that realistic stable, robust, and adaptive map development can be achieved by including two low-level mechanisms originally motivated from single-neuron results. Specifically, contrast-gain control in the retinal ganglion cells and the lateral geniculate nucleus reduces variation in the presynaptic drive due to differences in input patterns, while homeostatic plasticity of V1 neuron excitability reduces the postsynaptic variability in firing rates. Together these two mechanisms, thought to be applicable across sensory systems in general, lead to biological maps that develop stably and robustly, yet adapt to the visual environment. The modeling results suggest that topographic map stability is a natural outcome of low-level processes of adaptation and normalization. The resulting model is more realistic, simpler, and far more robust, and is thus a good starting point for future studies of cortical map development.},

abstract = {Two-photon calcium imaging is a powerful means for monitoring the activity of distinct neurons in brain tissue in vivo. In the mammalian brain, such imaging studies have been restricted largely to calcium recordings from neurons that were individually dye-loaded through microelectrodes. Previous attempts to use membrane-permeant forms of fluorometric calcium indicators to load populations of neurons have yielded satisfactory results only in cell cultures or in slices of immature brain tissue. Here we introduce a versatile approach for loading membrane-permeant fluorescent indicator dyes in large populations of cells. We established a pressure ejection-based local dye delivery protocol that can be used for a large spectrum of membrane-permeant indicator dyes, including calcium green-1 acetoxymethyl (AM) ester, Fura-2 AM, Fluo-4 AM, and Indo-1 AM. We applied this dye-loading protocol successfully in mouse brain tissue at any developmental stage from newborn to adult in vivo and in vitro. In vivo two-photon Ca2+ recordings, obtained by imaging through the intact skull, indicated that whisker deflection-evoked Ca2+ transients occur in a subset of layer 2/3 neurons of the barrel cortex. Thus, our results demonstrate the suitability of this technique for real-time analyses of intact neuronal circuits with the resolution of individual cells.},

abstract = {Nearly all models of direction selectivity (DS) in visual cortex are based on feedforward connection schemes, where geniculate input provides all excitatory synaptic input to both pyramidal and inhibitory neurons. Feedforward inhibition then suppresses feedforward excitation for nonoptimal stimuli. Anatomically, however, the majority of asymmetric, excitatory, synaptic contacts onto cortical cells is provided by other cortical neurons, as embodied in the Canonical Microcircuit of Douglas and Martin (1991). In this view, weak geniculate input is strongly amplified in the preferred direction by the action of intracortical excitatory connections, while in the null direction inhibition reduces geniculate-induced excitation. We investigate analytically and through biologically realistic computer simulations the functioning of a cortical network based on massive excitatory, cortico-cortical feedback. The behavior of this network is compared to physiological data as well as to the behavior of a purely feedforward model of DS based on nonlagged input. Our model explains a number of puzzling features of direction selective simple cells, including the small somatic input conductance changes that have been measured experimentally during stimulation in the null direction, and the persistence of DS while fully blocking inhibition in a single cell. Although the operation at the heart of our network is amplification, the network passes the linearity test of (Jagadeesh et al., 1993). We make specific predictions concerning the effect of selective blockade of cortical inhibition on the velocity-response curve.},

Two mechanisms mitigate these burdens: attention prioritizes stimulus processing on the basis of motivational relevance, and expectations constrain visual interpretation on the basis of prior likelihood. Of the two, attention has been extensively investigated while expectation has been relatively neglected. Here, we review recent work that has begun to delineate a neurobiology of visual expectation, and contrast the findings with those of the attention literature, to explore how these two central influences on visual perception overlap, differ and interact.},

abstract = {'Fast-spike' interneurons of layer 4 mediate thalamocortical feedforward inhibition and can, with some confidence, be identified using extracellular methods. In somatosensory barrel cortex of awake rabbits, these 'suspected inhibitory interneurons' (SINs) have distinct receptive field properties: they respond to vibrissa displacement with very high sensitivity and temporal fidelity. However, they lack the directional specificity that is clearly seen in most of their ventrobasal thalamocortical afferents. Several lines of evidence show that layer-4 SINs receive a potent and highly convergent and divergent functional input from topographically aligned thalamocortical neurons. Whereas the unselective pooling of convergent thalamocortical inputs onto SINs generates sensitive and broadly tuned inhibitory receptive fields, the potent divergence of single thalamocortical neurons onto many SINs generates sharply synchronous (+/-1 ms) activity (because of coincident EPSPs). Synchronous discharge of these interneurons following thalamocortical impulses will generate a synchronous feedforward release of GABA within the barrel. Thalamocortical impulses will, therefore, generate only a brief 'window of excitability' during which spikes can occur in the post-synaptic targets of fast-spike interneurons. This fast, synchronous, highly sensitive and broadly tuned feed-forward inhibitory network is well suited to suppress spike generation in spiny neurons following all but the most optimal feedforward excitatory inputs.},

abstract = {Primary visual cortex (V1) is the site at which orientation selectivity emerges in mammals: visual thalamus afferents to V1 respond equally to all stimulus orientations, whereas their target V1 neurons respond selectively to stimulus orientation. The emergence of orientation selectivity in V1 has long served as a model for investigating cortical computation. Recent evidence for orientation selectivity in mouse V1 opens cortical computation to dissection by genetic and imaging tools, but also raises two essential questions: (1) How does orientation selectivity in mouse V1 neurons compare with that in previously described species? (2) What is the synaptic basis for orientation selectivity in mouse V1? A comparison of orientation selectivity in mouse and in cat, where such measures have traditionally been made, reveals that orientation selectivity in mouse V1 is weaker than in cat V1, but that spike threshold plays a similar role in narrowing selectivity between membrane potential and spike rate. To uncover the synaptic basis for orientation selectivity, we made whole-cell recordings in vivo from mouse V1 neurons, comparing neuronal input selectivity—based on membrane potential, synaptic excitation, and synaptic inhibition—to output selectivity based on spiking. We found that a neuron's excitatory and inhibitory inputs are selective for the same stimulus orientations as is its membrane potential response, and that inhibitory selectivity is not broader than excitatory selectivity. Inhibition has different dynamics than excitation, adapting more rapidly. In neurons with temporally modulated responses, the timing of excitation and inhibition was different in mice and cats.},

abstract = {To elucidate the effect of visual experience on the development of orientation maps, we conducted intrinsic signal optical imaging of the visual cortex of kittens that were continuously exposed to a single orientation through cylindrical-lens-fitted goggles under a freely moving condition starting at post-natal week 3. We observed a rapid reorganization of orientation maps, characterized by extensive representation of exposed orientations with reduced responsiveness to unexposed orientations. The over-representation of exposed orientation was marked for 1-2 weeks of goggle rearing. A longer period of goggle rearing, however, decreased the degree of over-representation, which still remained at a remarkable level. Dark rearing episodes daily interleaved between single orientation exposures moderated the over-representation effect. Unit recording from goggle-reared kittens showed preferred orientations consistent with optical imaging. Using c-Fos immunoreactivity mapping, we showed that the number of neurons strongly responding to the exposed orientation was 3 times larger in a goggle-reared cat than the number of neurons responding to the vertical orientation in a normal cat. Taken together, these results suggest that the reorganization of orientation maps was caused by the expansion of domains maximally responding to exposed orientation as well as the strong reduction of responses to unexposed orientations.},

The general solution for STRF estimation requires normalization of the stimulus-response cross-correlation by the stimulus autocorrelation matrix. When the second-order stimulus statistics are stationary, normalization involves only the diagonal elements of the Fourier-transformed auto-correlation matrix (the power spectrum). In the non-stationary case normalization requires the entire auto-correlation matrix. We present modelling studies that demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of this method as well as neurophysiological data comparing STRFs estimated using natural versus synthetic stimulus ensembles. For both auditory and visual neurons, STRFs obtained with these different stimuli are similar, but exhibit systematic differences that may be functionally significant. This method should be useful for determining what aspects of natural signals are represented by sensory neurons and may reveal novel response properties of these neurons.},

Here we investigated the mechanisms of attention in the striate cortex of monkeys performing a spatial or an object-based attention task at various stimulus contrasts and compared neuronal contrast response functions with and without attention. Our data are best described by an "additive" interaction: The influence of attention on the neuronal response is relatively independent of the stimulus contrast, at least when the stimulus has enough contrast to become visible. This shows that attention adds to the neuronal responses in a largely contrast invariant manner. These data support recent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies and suggest that feedback from higher areas exerts a constant attentional drive that is mostly task not stimulus driven.},

abstract = {Antibodies to muscarinic cholinergic receptor proteins m1 to m4 were used in striate cortex tissue of normal rhesus monkeys to determine the laminar distribution of these proteins with special attention to geniculorecipient layers. The normal patterns were compared to those of monkeys whose ocular dominance system had been altered by visual deprivation. In normal monkeys, immunoreactivity of all four proteins was localized in complex laminar patterns; m1 was densest in layers 2, 3, and 6, followed by layer 5. In contrast, m2 reactivity was densest in lower layer 4C and in 4A; the latter exhibited a honeycomb pattern. Layers 2 and 3 displayed alternating dense and light regions; this pattern was complementary to that of cytochrome oxidase (CytOx). Laminar immunoreactivity for the m3 receptor was similar to the CytOx pattern, including a honeycomb in 4A and a pattern of alternating darker and lighter patches in layers 2/3. Antibody to m4 reacted most densely with layers 1, 2, 3, and 5, layers 2 and 3 exhibited alternating dark and light regions, and layer 4A had a faint honeycomb. Layer 4C was the lightest band. The differential distribution of these four muscarinic receptor subtypes suggests distinct roles in cholinergic modulation of visual processing in the primate striate cortex. Furthermore, all four muscarinic receptors appear to be insensitive to elimination of visual input via monocular occlusion from birth, to deprivation of pattern vision in one eye during a specific time period in adulthood, and to long-term retinal injury.},

abstract = {Neuronal receptive fields (RFs) play crucial roles in visual processing. While the linear RFs of early neurons have been well studied, RFs of cortical complex cells are nonlinear and therefore difficult to characterize, especially in the context of natural stimuli. In this study, we used a nonlinear technique to compute the RFs of complex cells from their responses to natural images. We found that each RF is well described by a small number of subunits, which are oriented, localized, and bandpass. These subunits contribute to neuronal responses in a contrast-dependent, polarity-invariant manner, and they can largely predict the orientation and spatial frequency tuning of the cell. Although the RF structures measured with natural images were similar to those measured with random stimuli, natural images were more effective for driving complex cells, thus facilitating rapid identification of the subunits. The subunit RF model provides a useful basis for understanding cortical processing of natural stimuli.},

abstract = {The origin of orientation selectivity in visual cortical responses is a central problem for understanding cerebral cortical circuitry. In cats, many experiments suggest that orientation selectivity arises from the arrangement of lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) afferents to layer 4 simple cells. However, this explanation is not sufficient to account for the contrast invariance of orientation tuning.To understand contrast invariance, we first characterize the input to cat simple cells generated by the oriented arrangement of LGN afferents. We demonstrate that it has two components: a spatial-phase-specific component (i.e., one that depends on receptive field spatial phase), which is tuned for orientation, and a phase-nonspecific component, which is untuned. Both components grow with contrast. Second, we show that a correlation-based intracortical circuit, in which connectivity between cell pairs is determined by the correlation of their LGN inputs, is sufficient to achieve well tuned, contrast-invariant orientation tuning. This circuit generates both spatially opponent, "antiphase" inhibition ("push-pull"), and spatially matched, "same-phase" excitation. The inhibition, if sufficiently strong, suppresses the untuned input component and sharpens responses to the tuned component at all contrasts. The excitation amplifies tuned responses. This circuit agrees with experimental evidence showing spatial opponency between, and similar orientation tuning of, the excitatory and inhibitory inputs received by a simple cell. Orientation tuning is primarily input driven, accounting for the observed invariance of tuning width after removal of intracortical synaptic input, as well as for the dependence of orientation tuning on stimulus spatial frequency. The model differs from previous push-pull models in requiring dominant rather than balanced inhibition and in predicting that a population of layer 4 inhibitory neurons should respond in a contrast-dependent manner to stimuli of all orientations, although their tuning width may be similar to that of excitatory neurons. The model demonstrates that fundamental response properties of cortical layer 4 can be explained by circuitry expected to develop under correlation-based rules of synaptic plasticity, and shows how such circuitry allows the cortex to distinguish stimulus intensity from stimulus form.},

abstract = {Maintaining the proper balance between excitation and inhibition is critical for the normal function of cortical circuits. This balance is thought to be maintained by an array of homeostatic mechanisms that regulate neuronal and circuit excitability, including mechanisms that target excitatory and inhibitory synapses, and mechanisms that target intrinsic neuronal excitability. In this review, I discuss where and when these mechanisms are used in complex microcircuits, what is currently known about the signaling pathways that underlie them, and how these different ways of achieving network stability cooperate and/or compete. An important challenge for the field of homeostatic plasticity is to assemble our understanding of these individual mechanisms into a coherent view of how microcircuit stability is maintained during experience-dependent circuit refinement.},

abstract = {We performed experiments in the cat geniculocortical pathway, in vivo, to examine how presynaptic spikes interact to influence the firing of postsynaptic targets. In particular, we asked (1) how do multiple spikes from a single presynaptic neuron interact to influence the firing of a postsynaptic target (homosynaptic interactions), (2) how do spikes from two different presynaptic neurons interact (heterosynaptic interactions), and (3) what is the time course of homosynaptic and heterosynaptic interactions? We found that both homosynaptic and heterosynaptic interactions increase the likelihood of driving a postsynaptic spike, although with different time courses. For two spikes traveling down a single geniculate axon, the second spike is more effective than the first for approximately 15 msec. For two spikes on separate axons, the interaction is faster ( approximately 7 msec duration, approximately 2.5 msec time constant). Thus changes in firing rate are perhaps best relayed by homosynaptic interactions, whereas heterosynaptic interactions may help detect coincident spikes from different thalamic inputs.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that the presence of immunoreactivity for parvalbumin (PV-IR) and calbindin-D 28k (Cal-IR) can be used as markers for certain types of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) immunoreactive interneurons in monkey cerebral cortex. Little quantitative information is available regarding the features that distinguish these two subpopulations, however. Therefore, in this study we localized PV-IR and Cal-IR neurons in Macaca monkey striate cortex and analyzed quantitatively their laminar distribution, cell morphology, and co-localization with GABA by double-labeling immunocytochemistry. PV-IR was found in nonpyramidal cells in all layers of the cortex, although PV-IR cells in layer 1 were rare. In contrast, Cal-IR was found mainly in nonpyramidal cells in two bands corresponding to layers 2-3 and 5-6. We found very few double-labeled PV-IR/Cal-IR cells but confirmed that almost all PV-IR and Cal-IR cells are GABAergic. Overall, 74\% of GABA neurons in striate cortex displayed PV-IR compared to only 12\% that displayed Cal-IR and 14\% that were GABA-IR only. Quantitative analysis indicated that the relative proportion of GABA cells that displayed PV-IR or Cal-IR showed conspicuous laminar differences, which were often complementary. Cell size measurements indicated that PV-IR/GABA cells in layers 2-3 and 5-6 were significantly larger than Cal-IR/GABA cells. Analysis of the size, shape, and orientation of stained cell bodies and proximal dendrites further demonstrated that each subpopulation contained several different types of smooth stellate cells, suggesting that Cal-IR and PV-IR are found in functionally and morphologically heterogeneous subpopulations of GABA neurons. There was a thick bundle of PV-IR axons in the white matter underlying the striate but not prestriate cortex. PV-IR punctate labeling matched the cytochrome oxidase staining pattern in layers 4A and 4C, suggesting that PV-IR is present in geniculocortical afferents as well as intrinsic neurons. Cal-IR neuropil staining was high in layers 1, 2, 4B, and 5, where cytochrome oxidase staining is relatively low. We did not find a preferential localization of either PV-IR or Cal-IR cell bodies in any cytochrome oxidase compartments in layers 2-3 of the cortex. These findings indicate that PV and Cal are distributed into different neuronal circuits.},

abstract = {The topographic organization of striate cortex in the macaque was studied using physiological recording techniques. Results were displayed on two-dimensional maps of the cortex, which facilitated the quantitative analysis of various features of the visual representation. The representation was found to be asymmetric with more cortex devoted to lower than to upper fields. Over much of striate cortex the representation is anisotropic, in that the magnification factor depends upon the direction along which it is measured. There is considerable individual variability in these features as well as in the overall size of striate cortex. Outside the fovea, the cortical representation shows only modest deviations from a logarithmic conformal mapping, in which the magnification factor is proportional to the inverse of eccentricity in the visual field. Comparison of receptive field size with cortical magnification was used to estimate the "point image size" in the cortex (i.e. the extent of cortex concerned with processing inputs from any given point in the visual field). Our evidence supports a previous report that point-image size varies significantly with eccentricity. This is of interest in relation to anatomical evidence that the dimensions of columnar systems in striate cortex are largely independent of eccentricity.},

abstract = {In mammalian neocortex, the orderly arrangement of columns of neurons is thought to be a fundamental organizing principle. In primary visual cortex (V1), neurons respond preferentially to bars of a particular orientation, and, in many mammals, these orientation-selective cells are arranged in a semiregular, smoothly varying map across the cortical surface. Curiously, orientation maps have not been found in rodents or lagomorphs. To explore whether this lack of organization in previously studied rodents could be attributable to low visual acuity, poorly differentiated visual brain areas, or small absolute V1 size, we examined V1 organization of a larger, highly visual rodent, the gray squirrel. Using intrinsic signal optical imaging and single-cell recordings, we found no evidence of an orientation map, suggesting that formation of orientation maps depends on mechanisms not found in rodents. We did find robust orientation tuning of single cells, and this tuning was invariant to stimulus contrast. Therefore, it seems unlikely that orientation maps are important for orientation tuning or its contrast invariance in V1. In vertical electrode penetrations, we found little evidence for columnar organization of orientation-selective neurons and little evidence for local anisotropy of orientation preferences. We conclude that an orderly and columnar arrangement of functional response properties is not a universal characteristic of cortical architecture.},

In primary visual cortex (V1) of mammals with orientation maps, horizontal connections ramify in periodic patches across the cortical surface, connecting cells with similar orientation preferences. Rodents have orientation-selective cells but lack orientation maps, raising questions about relationships of horizontal connections to functional maps and receptive field properties. To address these questions, we studied anatomy of horizontal connections and characterized horizontal functional interactions in V1 of the gray squirrel, a highly visual rodent. Long-range intrinsic connections in squirrel V1 extended 1-2 mm but were not patchy or periodic. This result suggests that periodic and patchy connectivity is not a universal organizing principle of cortex, and the existence of patchy and periodic connectivity and functional maps may be linked. In multielectrode and intracellular recordings, we found evidence of unselective local interactions among cells, similar to pinwheel centers of carnivores. These data suggest that, in mammals with and without orientation maps, local connections link near neighbors without regard to orientation selectivity. In single-unit recordings, we found length-summing and end-stopped cells that were similar to those in other mammals. Length-summing cell surrounds were orientation selective, whereas surrounds of end-stopped cells were not. Receptive field response classes are quite similar across mammals, and therefore patchy and columnar connectivity may not be essential for these properties.},

abstract = {Visual experience plays a critical role in the development of direction-selective responses in ferret visual cortex. In visually naive animals, presentation of a bidirectional "training" stimulus induces rapid increases in the direction-selective responses of single neurons that can be predicted by small but significant direction biases that are present in neighboring neurons at the onset of stimulation. In this study we used in vivo two-photon imaging of calcium signals to further explore the contribution of visual experience to the emergence of direction- selective responses in ferret visual cortex. The first set of experiments was designed to determine whether visual experience is required for the development of the initial neighborhood bias. In animals that were dark-reared until the time of eye opening, we found that individual neurons exhibited weak direction-selective responses accompanied by a reduced but statistically significant neighborhood bias, indicating that both features arise without the need for visual experience. The second set of experiments used a unidirectional training stimulus to assess the relative roles of the neighborhood bias and visual experience in determining the direction preference that cortical neurons acquire during direction training. We found that neurons became more responsive to the trained direction even when they were located in regions of the cortex with an initial neighborhood bias for the direction opposite the training stimulus. Together, these results suggest an adaptive developmental strategy for the elaboration of direction-selective responses, one in which experience-independent mechanisms provide a symmetry-breaking seed for the instructive effects of visual experience.},

abstract = {Tree shrew primary visual cortex (V1) exhibits a pronounced laminar segregation of inputs from different classes of relay neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). We examined how several receptive field (RF) properties were transformed from LGN to V1 layer 4 to V1 layer 2/3. The progression of RF properties across these stages differed markedly from that found in the cat. V1 layer 4 cells are largely similar to the the LGN cells that provide their input, being dominated by a single sign (ON or OFF) and being strongly modulated by sinusoidal gratings. Some layer 4 neurons, notably those near the edges of layer 4, exhibited increased orientation selectivity, and most layer 4 neurons exhibited a preference for lower temporal frequencies. Neurons in cortical layer 2/3 differ significantly from those in the LGN; most exhibited strong orientation tuning and both ON and OFF responses. The strength of orientation selectivity exhibited a notable sublaminar organization, with the strongest orientation tuned neurons in the most superficial parts of layer 2/3. Modulation indexes provide evidence for simple and complex cells in both layer 4 and layer 2/3. However, neurons with high modulation indexes were heterogenous in the spatial organization of ON and OFF responses, with many of them exhibiting unbalanced ON and OFF responses rather than well-segregated ON and OFF subunits. When compared to the laminar organization of V1 in other mammals, these data show that the process of natural selection can result in significantly altered structure/function relationships in homologous cortical circuits.},

abstract = {Visual acuity is limited by the size and density of the smallest retinal ganglion cells, which correspond to the midget ganglion cells in primate retina and the beta-ganglion cells in cat retina, both of which have concentric receptive fields that respond at either light-On or light-Off. In contrast, the smallest ganglion cells in the rabbit retina are the local edge detectors (LEDs), which respond to spot illumination at both light-On and light-Off. However, the LEDs do not predominate in the rabbit retina and the question arises, what role do they play in fine spatial vision? We studied the morphology and physiology of LEDs in the isolated rabbit retina and examined how their response properties are shaped by the excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Although the LEDs comprise only approximately 15\% of the ganglion cells, neighboring LEDs are separated by 30-40 microm on the visual streak, which is sufficient to account for the grating acuity of the rabbit. The spatial and temporal receptive-field properties of LEDs are generated by distinct inhibitory mechanisms. The strong inhibitory surround acts presynaptically to suppress both the excitation and the inhibition elicited by center stimulation. The temporal properties, characterized by sluggish onset, sustained firing, and low bandwidth, are mediated by the temporal properties of the bipolar cells and by postsynaptic interactions between the excitatory and inhibitory inputs. We propose that the LEDs signal fine spatial detail during visual fixation, when high temporal frequencies are minimal.},

abstract = {In this study we used a modified double-label deoxyglucose procedure to investigate attention-dependent modulations of deoxyglucose uptake at the earliest stages of the macaque visual system. Specifically, we compared activity levels evoked during two tasks with essentially identical visual stimulation requiring different attentional demands. During a featural-attention task, the subjects had to discriminate the orientation of a grating; during a control spatial-attention task, they had to localize the position of a target point. Comparison of the resulting activity maps revealed attention-dependent changes in metabolic activity in portions of the magnocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus, and the magnocellular-recipient layers 4Calpha and 4B of the striate cortex. In these early stages of the visual system, attention to the orientation of the grating suppressed the metabolic activity in a retinotopically specific band peripheral to the representation of the stimulus. These results favor an early selection model of attention. After a thalamic attention-dependent gating mechanism, irrelevant visual information outside the focus of attention may be suppressed at the level of the striate cortex, which would then result in an increased signal-to-noise ratio for the processing of the attended feature in higher-tier, less retinotopically organized, extrastriate visual areas.},

Here, we propose a method to distinguish between these two alternatives. The human psychometric function for detection of a single target as a function of its duration can be used to predict the corresponding function for two or more attended targets. Importantly, the predicted curves differ, depending on whether a parallel or sampling strategy is assumed. For a challenging detection task, we found that human performance was best reflected by a sampling model, indicating that multiple items of interest were processed in series at a rate of approximately seven items per second. Surprisingly, the data suggested that attention operated in this periodic regime, even when it was focused on a single target. That is, attention might rely on an intrinsically periodic process.},

Stimuli were centered over the classical receptive field (CRF) and stimulus size was varied from one to four times the diameter of the CRF. Stimulus movies reproduced the spatial and temporal stimulus dynamics of natural vision while maintaining constant CRF stimulation across all sizes. In individual neurons, stimulation of the nCRF significantly increases the information rate, the information per spike, and the efficiency of information transmission. Furthermore, the population averages of these quantities also increase significantly with nCRF stimulation. These data demonstrate that the nCRF increases the sparseness of the stimulus representation in V1, suggesting that the nCRF tunes V1 neurons to match the highly informative components of the natural world.},

Such a balance could be established and maintained in an experience-dependent manner by synaptic plasticity at inhibitory synapses. We show that this mechanism provides an explanation for the sparse firing patterns observed in response to natural stimuli and fits well with a recently observed interaction of excitatory and inhibitory receptive field plasticity. The introduction of inhibitory plasticity in suitable recurrent networks provides a homeostatic mechanism that leads to asynchronous irregular network states. Further, it can accommodate synaptic memories with activity patterns that become indiscernible from the background state but can be reactivated by external stimuli. Our results suggest an essential role of inhibitory plasticity in the formation and maintenance of functional cortical circuitry.},

Unfortunately, extracting the spike train of each neuron from a raw fluorescence movie is a nontrivial problem. This work presents a fast nonnegative deconvolution filter to infer the approximately most likely spike train of each neuron, given the fluorescence observations. This algorithm outperforms optimal linear deconvolution (Wiener filtering) on both simulated and biological data. The performance gains come from restricting the inferred spike trains to be positive (using an interior-point method), unlike the Wiener filter. The algorithm runs in linear time, and is fast enough that even when simultaneously imaging >100 neurons, inference can be performed on the set of all observed traces faster than real time. Performing optimal spatial filtering on the images further refines the inferred spike train estimates. Importantly, all the parameters required to perform the inference can be estimated using only the fluorescence data, obviating the need to perform joint electrophysiological and imaging calibration experiments.},

abstract = {As recent advances in calcium sensing technologies facilitate simultaneously imaging action potentials in neuronal populations, complementary analytical tools must also be developed to maximize the utility of this experimental paradigm. Although the observations here are fluorescence movies, the signals of interest--spike trains and/or time varying intracellular calcium concentrations--are hidden. Inferring these hidden signals is often problematic due to noise, nonlinearities, slow imaging rate, and unknown biophysical parameters. We overcome these difficulties by developing sequential Monte Carlo methods (particle filters) based on biophysical models of spiking, calcium dynamics, and fluorescence. We show that even in simple cases, the particle filters outperform the optimal linear (i.e., Wiener) filter, both by obtaining better estimates and by providing error bars. We then relax a number of our model assumptions to incorporate nonlinear saturation of the fluorescence signal, as well external stimulus and spike history dependence (e.g., refractoriness) of the spike trains. Using both simulations and in vitro fluorescence observations, we demonstrate temporal superresolution by inferring when within a frame each spike occurs. Furthermore, the model parameters may be estimated using expectation maximization with only a very limited amount of data (e.g., approximately 5-10 s or 5-40 spikes), without the requirement of any simultaneous electrophysiology or imaging experiments.},

abstract = {Most current computational models of neocortical networks assume a homogeneous and isotropic arrangement of local synaptic couplings between neurons. Sparse, recurrent connectivity is typically implemented with simple statistical wiring rules. For spatially extended networks, however, such random graph models are inadequate because they ignore the traits of neuron geometry, most notably various distance dependent features of horizontal connectivity. It is to be expected that such non-random structural attributes have a great impact, both on the spatio-temporal activity dynamics and on the biological function of neocortical networks. Here we review the neuroanatomical literature describing long-range horizontal connectivity in the neocortex over distances of up to eight millimeters, in various cortical areas and mammalian species. We extract the main common features from these data to allow for improved models of large-scale cortical networks. Such models include, next to short-range neighborhood coupling, also long-range patchy connections. We show that despite the large variability in published neuroanatomical data it is reasonable to design a generic model which generalizes over different cortical areas and mammalian species. Later on, we critically discuss this generalization, and we describe some examples of how to specify the model in order to adapt it to specific properties of particular cortical areas or species.},

The paucity of this cell population has been a major hindrance for detailed electrophysiological investigations. To facilitate functional studies, we generated transgenic mice that express enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive neurons. Aided by the transgene expression, the characterization of distinct cholinergic interneurons was possible. These cells were located in layer 2-3, had a bipolar morphology, were calretinin- and vasoactive intestinal peptide positive, but had a non-GABAergic phenotype. Paired recordings showed that EGFP/ChAT-positive neurons receive excitatory and inhibitory input from adjacent principal cells and various types of interneurons. However, EGFP/ChAT-positive neurons do not exert direct postsynaptic responses in neighboring neurons. Interestingly, prolonged activation of EGFP-labeled cholinergic neurons induces an increase in spontaneous EPSCs in adjacent pyramidal neurons. This indirect effect is mediated by nicotinic receptors that are presumably presynaptically localized. Thus, intrinsic bipolar cholinergic neurons can modulate cortical function locally.},

abstract = {Changes of ocular dominance in the visual cortex can be induced by visual manipulations during a critical period in early life. However, the role of critical period plasticity in normal development is unknown. Here we show that at the onset of this time window, the preferred orientations of individual cortical cells in the mouse are mismatched through the two eyes and the mismatch decreases and reaches adult levels by the end of the period. Deprivation of visual experience during this period irreversibly blocks the binocular matching of orientation preference, but has no effect in adulthood. The critical period of binocular matching can be delayed by long-term visual deprivation from birth, like that of ocular dominance plasticity. These results demonstrate that activity-dependent changes induced by normal visual experience during the well-studied critical period serve to match eye-specific inputs in the cortex, thus revealing a physiological role for critical period plasticity during normal development.},

abstract = {The brain is able to adapt rapidly and continually to the surrounding environment, becoming increasingly sensitive to important and frequently encountered stimuli. It is often claimed that this adaptive learning is highly task-specific, that is, we become more sensitive to the critical signals in the tasks we attend to. Here, we show a new type of perceptual learning, which occurs without attention, without awareness and without any task relevance. Subjects were repeatedly presented with a background motion signal so weak that its direction was not visible; the invisible motion was an irrelevant background to the central task that engaged the subject's attention. Despite being below the threshold of visibility and being irrelevant to the central task, the repetitive exposure improved performance specifically for the direction of the exposed motion when tested in a subsequent suprathreshold test. These results suggest that a frequently presented feature sensitizes the visual system merely owing to its frequency, not its relevance or salience.},

@article{Webb2005,
abstract = {The response of a neuron in striate cortex to an optimally configured visual stimulus is generally reduced when the stimulus is enlarged to encroach on a suppressive region that surrounds its classical receptive field (CRF). To characterize the mechanism that gives rise to this suppression, we measured its spatiotemporal tuning, its susceptibility to contrast adaptation, and its capacity for interocular transfer. Responses to an optimally configured grating confined to the CRF were strongly suppressed by annular surrounding gratings drifting at a wide range of temporal and spatial frequencies (including spatially uniform fields) that extended from well below to well above the range that drives most cortical neurons. Suppression from gratings capable of driving cortical CRFs was profoundly reduced by contrast adaptation and showed substantial interocular transfer. Suppression from stimuli that lay outside the spatiotemporal passband of most cortical CRFs was relatively stronger when the stimulus on the CRF was of low contrast, was generally insusceptible to contrast adaptation, and showed little interocular transfer. Our findings point to the existence of two mechanisms of surround suppression: one that is prominent when high-contrast stimuli drive the CRF, is orientation selective, has relatively sharp spatiotemporal tuning, is binocularly driven, and can be substantially desensitized by adaptation; the other is relatively more prominent when low-contrast stimuli drive the CRF, has very broad spatiotemporal tuning, is monocularly driven, and is insusceptible to adaptation. Its character suggests an origin in the input layers of primary visual cortex, or earlier.},

A significant correlation was found between the layout of iso-orientation columns and the pattern of evoked synaptic inputs between cortical sites: the largest-amplitude inhibitory and excitatory synaptic responses were evoked in single neurons when stimulation and recording electrodes were located in orientation columns sharing the same angle preference. Both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic responses decreased in amplitude when stimulation and recording electrodes were located in orientation columns with orthogonal angle preferences. Changing the stimulus intensity altered the balance of evoked excitation and inhibition without changing the columnar specificity of inputs.

abstract = {Sensory experience begins when neural circuits in the cerebral cortex are still immature; however, the contribution of experience to cortical maturation remains unclear. In the visual cortex, the selectivity of neurons for oriented stimuli at the time of eye opening is poor and increases dramatically after the onset of visual experience. Here we investigate whether visual experience has a significant role in the maturation of orientation selectivity and underlying cortical circuits using two forms of deprivation: dark rearing, which completely eliminates experience, and binocular lid suture, which alters the pattern of sensory driven activity. Orientation maps were present in dark-reared ferrets, but fully mature levels of tuning were never attained. In contrast, only rudimentary levels of orientation selectivity were observed in lid-sutured ferrets. Despite these differences, horizontal connections in both groups were less extensive and less clustered than normal, suggesting that long-range cortical processing is not essential for the expression of orientation selectivity, but may be needed for the full maturation of tuning. Thus, experience is beneficial or highly detrimental to cortical maturation, depending on the pattern of sensory driven activity.},

We address 2 such phenomena: surround suppression and receptive field expansion at low contrast. We present rigorous computational support for the hypothesis that the phenomena largely result from local short-range (< 0.5 mm) cortical connections and lateral geniculate nucleus input. The neural mechanisms of surround suppression in our simulations operate via (A) enhancement of inhibition, (B) reduction of excitation, or (C) action of both simultaneously. Mechanisms (B) and (C) are substantially more prevalent than (A). We observe, on average, a growth in the spatial summation extent of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs for low-contrast stimuli. However, we find this is neither sufficient nor necessary to explain receptive field expansion at low contrast, which usually involves additional changes in the relative gain of these inputs.},

abstract = {Video-enhanced differential interference contrast optics was used to determine the number and distribution of photoreceptors across the entire retinal surface of 9 eyes obtained from 7 adult rhesus monkeys. We found that the retina of this primate contains an average of 3,100,000 cones (+/- 130,000) and 61,000,000 rods (+/- 7,500,000). Variation among animals in the number of rods and cones cannot be accounted for by differences in sex, age, or retinal surface area, nor is there a correlation between the number of rods and cones (a retina with a high number of rods does not typically have a high number of cones). Cone density peaks at 141,000 cones/mm2 in the foveola and decreases about 100-fold toward the periphery. Rod density in a central annulus around the fovea is 130,000/mm2 and decreases 6-8-fold toward the periphery. In all 9 retinae, we found that an area 4-5 mm dorsal to the fovea had the highest rod density at 184,000 rods/mm2. The functional significance of this area, which we term the dorsal rod peak (DRP), may be related to high sensitivity vision under scotopic conditions. Outside of the DRP, rod density is symmetrical around the major axes of the retina, whereas cone density is elevated in nasal retina. Among animals, both rods and cones display a 2-fold individual difference in receptor density at any given eccentricity. Although rods and cones differ in absolute number, the location and magnitude of their peak densities, and their central to peripheral density gradients, the ratio of the density of rods to cones (15-30:1) is remarkably stable from 3 mm to 15 mm eccentricity. The relative consistency in the proportion of rods and cones in extrafoveal retina may be related to mechanisms of retinal development and functional interactions between scotopic and photopic systems.},

To determine how V2 represents natural images, we used a novel nonlinear system identification approach to obtain quantitative estimates of spatial tuning across a large sample of V2 neurons. We compared these tuning estimates with those obtained in area V1, in which the neural code is relatively well understood. We find two subpopulations of neurons in V2. Approximately one-half of the V2 neurons have tuning that is similar to V1. The other half of the V2 neurons are selective for complex features such as those that occur in natural scenes. These neurons are distinguished from V1 neurons mainly by the presence of stronger suppressive tuning. Selectivity in these neurons therefore reflects a balance between excitatory and suppressive tuning for specific features. These results provide a new perspective on how complex shape selectivity arises, emphasizing the role of suppressive tuning in determining stimulus selectivity in higher visual cortex.},

abstract = {We describe the Berkeley wavelet transform (BWT), a two-dimensional triadic wavelet transform. The BWT comprises four pairs of mother wavelets at four orientations. Within each pair, one wavelet has odd symmetry, and the other has even symmetry. By translation and scaling of the whole set (plus a single constant term), the wavelets form a complete, orthonormal basis in two dimensions. The BWT shares many characteristics with the receptive fields of neurons in mammalian primary visual cortex (V1). Like these receptive fields, BWT wavelets are localized in space, tuned in spatial frequency and orientation, and form a set that is approximately scale invariant. The wavelets also have spatial frequency and orientation bandwidths that are comparable with biological values. Although the classical Gabor wavelet model is a more accurate description of the receptive fields of individual V1 neurons, the BWT has some interesting advantages. It is a complete, orthonormal basis and is therefore inexpensive to compute, manipulate, and invert. These properties make the BWT useful in situations where computational power or experimental data are limited, such as estimation of the spatiotemporal receptive fields of neurons.},

Natural scenes have many theoretical and practical advantages over traditional, artificial stimuli; however, the receptive-field estimation methods are more complex than for white-noise stimuli. Here, we describe and justify several of these methods-spectral correction of the reverse correlation estimate, direct least-squares solution, iterative least-squares algorithms and regularized least-squares solutions. We investigate the pros and cons of the different methods, and evaluate them in a head-to-head comparison for simulated simple-cell data. This shows that, at least for quasilinear simulated simple cells, a regularized solution ('reginv') is most efficient, requiring fewer stimulus presentations for high-resolution reconstruction of the first-order kernel. We also investigate several practical issues that determine the success of this kind of experiment-the effects of neuronal nonlinearities, response variability and the choice of stimulus regime.},

We find that soma-targeting, parvalbumin-expressing (PV) neurons principally divide responses but preserve stimulus selectivity, whereas dendrite-targeting, somatostatin-expressing (SOM) neurons principally subtract from excitatory responses and sharpen selectivity. Visualized in vivo cell-attached recordings show that division by PV neurons alters response gain, whereas subtraction by SOM neurons shifts response levels. Finally, stimulating identified neurons while scanning many target cells reveals that single PV and SOM neurons functionally impact only specific subsets of neurons in their projection fields. These findings provide direct evidence that inhibitory neuronal subclasses have distinct and complementary roles in cortical computations.},

abstract = {One of the functions of the cerebral cortex is to increase the selectivity for stimulus features. Finding more about the mechanisms of increased cortical selectivity is important for understanding how the cortex works. Up to now, studies in multiple cortical areas have reported that suppressive mechanisms are involved in feature selectivity. However, the magnitude of the contribution of suppression to tuning selectivity is not yet determined. We use orientation selectivity in macaque primary visual cortex, V1, as an archetypal example of cortical feature selectivity and develop a method to estimate the magnitude of the contribution of suppression to orientation selectivity. The results show that untuned suppression, one form of cortical suppression, decreases the orthogonal-to-preferred response ratio (O/P ratio) of V1 cells from an average of 0.38 to 0.26. Untuned suppression has an especially large effect on orientation selectivity for highly selective cells (O/P < 0.2). Therefore, untuned suppression is crucial for the generation of highly orientation-selective cells in V1 cortex.},

abstract = {Subtypes of GABAergic interneurons (INs) are crucial for cortical function, yet their specific roles are largely unknown. In contrast to supra- and infragranular layers, where most somatostatin-expressing (SOM) INs are layer 1-targeting Martinotti cells, the axons of SOM INs in layer 4 of somatosensory cortex largely remain within layer 4. Moreover, we found that whereas layers 2/3 SOM INs target mainly pyramidal cells (PCs), layer 4 SOM INs target mainly fast-spiking (FS) INs. Accordingly, optogenetic inhibition of SOM INs in an active cortical network increases the firing of layers 2/3 PCs whereas it decreases the firing of layer 4 principal neurons (PNs). This unexpected effect of SOM INs on layer 4 PNs occurs via their inhibition of local FS INs. These results reveal a disinhibitory microcircuit in the thalamorecipient layer through interactions among subtypes of INs and suggest that the SOM IN-mediated disinhibition represents an important circuit mechanism for cortical information processing.},

abstract = {The activity of V1 neurons evoked by stimuli within the classical receptive field (CRF) is known to be modulated by stimuli in the surrounding field, the extra-receptive field (ERF). By varying the relative spatial phase (RSP) between a central grating presented in the CRF and a surround grating in the ERF, we studied the contextual modulation in V1 neurons of alert monkeys (Macaca mulata). Results from two monkeys show that most of the V1 neurons with suppressive ERF are sensitive to the RSP, and the degree of sensitivity is strongly dependent on the strength of ERF suppression. This sensitivity is maximal when the RSP is generated at or near CRF/ERF boundary, but is observed over the entire ERF. Interestingly, the suppressive effect of the surround grating can be largely abolished by inserting a narrow gap between the center and surround gratings or by a phase displacement between them corresponding to <10\% of the CRF diameter. These properties of V1 neurons may serve important perceptual functions.},

abstract = {Despite the presence of numerous inhibitory cell types, laminar excitatory input has only been characterized for limited identified types, and it is unknown whether there are differences between cell types in their laminar sources of inhibitory input. In the present study, we characterized sources of local input to nine distinct types of layer 2/3 inhibitory neurons in living slices of mouse somatosensory cortex. Whole-cell recordings from identified cell types, facilitated by use of transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein in limited inhibitory neuron populations, were combined with laser scanning photostimulation. We found that each inhibitory cell type received distinct excitatory and inhibitory laminar input patterns. Excitatory inputs could be grouped into three categories. All inhibitory cell types received strong excitation from layer 2/3, and for calretinin (CR)-positive Martinotti cells and burst-spiking interneurons, this was their dominant source of excitatory input. Three other cell types, including fast-spiking basket cells, CR-negative Martinotti cells, and bipolar interneurons, also received strong excitatory input from layer 4. The remaining four inhibitory cell types, including chandelier cells, neurogliaform cells, irregular spiking basket cells, and regular spiking presumptive basket cells, received strong excitatory input from layer 5A and not layer 4. Laminar sources of inhibitory input varied between cell types and could not be predicted from the sources of excitatory input. Thus, there are cell-type specific differences in laminar sources of both excitation and inhibition, and complementary input patterns from layer 4 versus layer 5A suggest cell type differences in their relationships to lemniscal versus paralemniscal pathways.},

abstract = {The cerebral cortex has diverse types of inhibitory neurons. In rat cortex, past research has shown that parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SOM), calretinin (CR), and cholecystokinin (CCK) label four distinct chemical classes of GABAergic interneurons. However, in contrast to rat cortex, previous studies indicate that there is significant colocalization of SOM and CR in mouse cortical inhibitory neurons. In the present study we further characterized immunochemical distinctions among mouse inhibitory cortical neurons by double immunochemical labeling with chemical markers. We found that, PV, SOM, and vasointenstinal peptide (VIP) reliably identify three nonoverlapping distinct subpopulations, as there was no overlap of immunoreactivity between PV and all the other chemical markers tested, and SOM and VIP did not show any overlap in labeled neurons in all the cortical areas. In comparison, there was significant overlap in combinations of other chemical markers. With some laminar and regional variations, the average overlap of SOM/CR (percentage of SOM+ cells expressing CR) and SOM/neuropeptide tyrosine (NPY) across all examined layers and cortical regions was 21.6\% and 7.1\%, respectively. The average overlap of VIP/CR, VIP/NPY, and CR/NPY was 34.2\%, 9.5\%, and 10\%, respectively. We quantified and assessed the percentages of marker-positive GABAergic cells, and showed that the nonoverlapping subpopulations (i.e., PV+, SOM+ and VIP+ cells) accounted for about 60\% of the GABAergic cell population. Taken together, our data reveal important chemical distinctions between mouse inhibitory cortical neurons and indicate that PV, SOM, and VIP can differentially label a majority of mouse inhibitory cortical neurons.},

abstract = {The cerebral cortex consists of multiple neuron subtypes whose electrophysiological properties exhibit diverse modulation patterns in response to neurotransmitters, including noradrenaline and acetylcholine (ACh). We performed multiple whole cell patch-clamp recording from layer V GABAergic interneurons and pyramidal cells of rat insular cortex (IC) to examine whether cholinergic effects on unitary inhibitory postsynaptic currents (uIPSCs) are differentially regulated by ACh receptors, depending on their presynaptic and postsynaptic cell subtypes. In fast-spiking (FS) to pyramidal cell synapses, carbachol (10 $\mu$M) invariably decreased uIPSC amplitude by 51.0\%, accompanied by increases in paired-pulse ratio (PPR) of the second to first uIPSC amplitude, coefficient of variation (CV) of the first uIPSC amplitude, and failure rate. Carbachol-induced uIPSC suppression was dose dependent and blocked by atropine, a muscarinic ACh receptor antagonist. Similar cholinergic suppression was observed in non-FS to pyramidal cell synapses. In contrast, FS to FS/non-FS cell synapses showed heterogeneous effects on uIPSC amplitude by carbachol. In roughly 40\% of pairs, carbachol suppressed uIPSCs by 35.8\%, whereas in a similar percentage of pairs uIPSCs were increased by 34.8\%. Non-FS to FS/non-FS cell synapses also showed carbachol-induced uIPSC facilitation by 29.2\% in about half of the pairs, whereas nearly 40\% of pairs showed carbachol-induced suppression of uIPSCs by 40.3\%. Carbachol tended to increase uIPSC amplitude in interneuron-to-interneuron synapses with higher PPR, suggesting that carbachol facilitates GABA release in interneuron synapses with lower release probability. These results suggest that carbachol-induced effects on uIPSCs are not homogeneous but preiotropic: i.e., cholinergic modulation of GABAergic synaptic transmission is differentially regulated depending on postsynaptic neuron subtypes.},

Microinjections of biocytin in layer 3 resulted in an asymmetric field (average anisotropy of 1.8; maximum spread--3.7 mm) of labeled axon terminal clusters in layers 1-3, with the longer axis of the label spread oriented orthogonal to the rows of blobs and imaged OD stripes, parallel to the V1/V2 border. These labeled terminal patches (n = 186) from either blob or interblob injections (n = 20) revealed a 71\% (132 out of 186) commitment of patches to the same compartment as the injection site; 11\% (20 out of 186) to the opposite compartment, and 18\% (34 out of 186) to borders of blob-interblob compartments, indicating that the connectivity pattern is not strictly blob to blob, or interblob to interblob (p < 0.005; chi(2)). In injections placed within single OD domains (n = 11), 54\% of the resulting labeled terminal patches (43 out of 79) fell into the same OD territories as the injection sites, 28\% (22 out of 79) into the opposite OD regions, and 18\% (14 out of 79) on borders, showing some connectional bias toward same-eye compartments (p < 0.02; ANOVA). Individual injection cases, however, varied in the degree (50-100\% for CO patterns, 22-100\% for OD patterns) to which they showed same-compartment connectivity. These results reveal that while connectivity between similar compartments predominates (e.g., blob to blob, right eye column to right eye column), interactions do occur between functionally different regions.},

abstract = {Uncertainty in various forms plagues our interactions with the environment. In a Bayesian statistical framework, optimal inference and prediction, based on unreliable observations in changing contexts, require the representation and manipulation of different forms of uncertainty. We propose that the neuromodulators acetylcholine and norepinephrine play a major role in the brain's implementation of these uncertainty computations. Acetylcholine signals expected uncertainty, coming from known unreliability of predictive cues within a context. Norepinephrine signals unexpected uncertainty, as when unsignaled context switches produce strongly unexpected observations. These uncertainty signals interact to enable optimal inference and learning in noisy and changeable environments. This formulation is consistent with a wealth of physiological, pharmacological, and behavioral data implicating acetylcholine and norepinephrine in specific aspects of a range of cognitive processes. Moreover, the model suggests a class of attentional cueing tasks that involve both neuromodulators and shows how their interactions may be part-antagonistic, part-synergistic.},

abstract = {The brain exhibits remarkable facility in exerting attentional control in most circumstances, but it also suffers apparent limitations in others. The authors' goal is to construct a rational account for why attentional control appears suboptimal under conditions of conflict and what this implies about the underlying computational principles. The formal framework used is based on Bayesian probability theory, which provides a convenient language for delineating the rationale and dynamics of attentional selection. The authors illustrate these issues with the Eriksen flanker task, a classical paradigm that explores the effects of competing sensory inputs on response tendencies. The authors show how 2 distinctly formulated models, based on compatibility bias and spatial uncertainty principles, can account for the behavioral data. They also suggest novel experiments that may differentiate these models. In addition, they elaborate a simplified model that approximates optimal computation and may map more directly onto the underlying neural machinery. This approximate model uses conflict monitoring, putatively mediated by the anterior cingulate cortex, as a proxy for compatibility representation. The authors also consider how this conflict information might be disseminated and used to control processing.},

abstract = {Neurophysiological and psychophysical evidence indicates that neuronal surround modulation at cross-orientation (orthogonal to the preferred orientation of the classical receptive field) plays a key role in intermediate-level visual tasks, such as textural segregation and perceptual pop-out. What is missing is a psychophysical description of cross surround modulation at the spatial filter level in low-level vision. Moreover, neurophysiological evidence for how cross surround modulation is expressed at the neuronal level has been inconsistent. Here we report evidence for psychophysical facilitation of contrast detection by cross surround stimuli (orthogonal to the target orientation) that may provide insights into both the neurophysiology and psychophysics of cross surround modulation. We found that cross surround facilitation is a surround-contrast dependent effect mainly evident at low surround contrasts, and is narrowly tuned to spatial frequency and broadly tuned to orientation. To understand whether cross surround facilitation results from low-level processing of signal-to-noise enhancement or is due to uncertainty reduction at a higher-level decision stage, we (1) studied cross surround facilitation with an equivalent noise protocol, (2) estimated the changes in the slope of the psychometric function and the uncertainty parameter, M, and (3) measured cross surround effects at the dipper of the TvC function. The converging evidence suggests that cross surround facilitation of contrast detection is mainly a result of low-level signal-to-noise enhancement, and is little affected by uncertainty change.},

abstract = {The most prominent feature of the Basal Forebrain (BF) is the collection of large cortically projecting neurons (basal nucleus of Meynert) that serve as the primary source of cholinergic input to the entire cortical mantle. Despite its broad involvement in cortical activation, attention, and memory, the functional details of the BF are not well understood due to the anatomical complexity of the region. This study tested the hypothesis that basalocortical connections reflect cortical connectivity patterns. Distinct retrograde tracers were deposited into various frontal and posterior cortical areas, and retrogradely labeled cholinergic and noncholinergic neurons were mapped in the BF. Concurrently, we mapped retrogradely labeled cells in posterior cortical areas that project to various frontal areas, and all cell populations were combined in the same coordinate system. Our studies suggest that the cholinergic and noncholinergic projections to the neocortex are not diffuse, but instead, are organized into segregated or overlapping pools of projection neurons. The extent of overlap between BF populations projecting to the cortex depends on the degree of connectivity between the cortical targets of these projection populations. We suggest that the organization of projections from the BF may enable parallel modulation of multiple groupings of interconnected yet nonadjacent cortical areas.},

abstract = {Top-down modulation of sensory processing allows the animal to select inputsmost relevant to current tasks.We found that the cingulate (Cg) region of themouse frontal cortex powerfully influences sensory processing in the primary visual cortex (V1) through long-range projections that activate local g-aminobutyric acid–ergic (GABAergic) circuits.Optogenetic activation of Cg neurons enhanced V1 neuron responses and improved visual discrimination. Focal activation of Cg axons in V1 caused a response increase at the activation site but a decrease at nearby locations (center-surround modulation).Whereas somatostatin-positive GABAergic interneurons contributed preferentially to surround suppression, vasoactive intestinal peptide-positive interneurons were crucial for center facilitation. Long-range corticocortical projections thus act through local microcircuits to exert spatially specific top-downmodulationof sensoryprocessing.},

abstract = {Vernier acuity is a measure of the smallest horizontal offset between two vertical lines that can be behaviorally discriminated. To examine the link between the neuronal responses in a retinotopic mosaic and vernier acuity, we recorded the responses of single cells in cat lateral geniculate nucleus to a vertical bar stimulus that was stepped in small increments through the receptive fields of cells. Based on the single-trial responses evoked by stimuli at different positions, we calculated the spatial resolution that could be achieved. If the stimulus could fall anywhere in their receptive fields, single neurons had spatial resolutions two times worse than previously reported vernier thresholds. Given the known coverage factor in a cat retina, we developed a two-stage decision model to examine how the responses of neurons in a retinotopic mosaic could be processed to achieve vernier acuity. In order for psychophysical thresholds to be accounted for by the responses of a single cell, the stimulus must fall in the quarter of the receptive field that provides the most information about stimulus position. Alternatively, both the absolute psychophysical threshold for vernier acuity and its dependence on stimulus length can be realized by pooling the responses of a few neurons, all located on one side of the bar stimulus.},

abstract = {Extracellular recordings were obtained from two cell classes in layer 4 of the awake rabbit primary visual cortex (V1): putative inhibitory interneurons [suspected inhibitory interneurons (SINs)] and putative excitatory cells with simple receptive fields. SINs were identified solely by their characteristic response to electrical stimulation of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN, 3+ spikes at >600 Hz), and simple cells were identified solely by receptive field structure, requiring spatially separate ON and/or OFF subfields. Notably, no cells met both criteria, and we studied 62 simple cells and 33 SINs. Fourteen cells met neither criterion. These layer 4 populations were markedly distinct. Thus, SINs were far less linear (F1/F0 < 1), more broadly tuned to stimulus orientation, direction, spatial and temporal frequency, more sensitive to contrast, had much higher spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity, and always had spatially overlapping ON/OFF receptive subfields. SINs responded to drifting gratings with increased firing rates (F0) for all orientations and directions. However, some SINs showed a weaker modulated (F1) response sharply tuned to orientation and/or direction. SINs responded at shorter latencies than simple cells to stationary stimuli, and the responses of both populations could be sustained or transient. Transient simple cells were more sensitive to contrast than sustained simple cells and their visual responses were more frequently suppressed by high contrasts. Finally, cross-correlation between LGN and SIN spike trains confirmed a fast and precisely timed monosynaptic connectivity, supporting the notion that SINs are well suited to provide a fast feedforward inhibition onto targeted cortical populations.},

abstract = {Cortical processing is strongly influenced by the actions of neuromodulators such as acetylcholine (ACh). Early studies in anaesthetized cats argued that acetylcholine can cause a sharpening of orientation tuning functions and an improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of neuronal responses in primary visual cortex (V1). Recent in vitro studies have demonstrated that acetylcholine reduces the efficacy of feedback and intracortical connections via the activation of muscarinic receptors, and increases the efficacy of feed-forward connections via the activation of nicotinic receptors. If orientation tuning is mediated or enhanced by intracortical connections, high levels of acetylcholine should diminish orientation tuning. Here we investigate the effects of acetylcholine on orientation tuning and neuronal responsiveness in anaesthetized marmoset monkeys. We found that acetylcholine caused a broadening of the orientation tuning in the majority of cells, while tuning functions became sharper in only a minority of cells. Moreover, acetylcholine generally facilitated neuronal responses, but neither improved signal-to-noise ratio, nor reduced trial-to-trial firing rate variance systematically. Acetylcholine did however, reduce variability of spike occurrences within spike trains. We discuss these findings in the context of dynamic control of feed-forward and lateral/feedback connectivity by acetylcholine.},

abstract = {Practice improves the performance in visual tasks, but mechanisms underlying this adult brain plasticity are unclear. Single-cell studies reported no [1], weak [2], or moderate [3, 4] perceptual learning-related changes in macaque visual areas V1 and V4, whereas none were found in middle temporal (MT) [5]. These conflicting results and modeling of human (e.g., [6, 7]) and monkey data [8] suggested that changes in the readout of visual cortical signals underlie perceptual learning, rather than changes in these signals. In the V4 learning studies, monkeys discriminated small differences in orientation, whereas in the MT study, the animals discriminated opponent motion directions. Analogous to the latter study, we trained monkeys to discriminate static orthogonal orientations masked by noise. V4 neurons showed robust increases in their capacity to discriminate the trained orientations during the course of the training. This effect was observed during discrimination and passive fixation but specifically for the trained orientations. The improvement in neural discrimination was due to decreased response variability and an increase of the difference between the mean responses for the two trained orientations. These findings demonstrate that perceptual learning in a coarse discrimination task indeed can change the response properties of a cortical sensory area.},
